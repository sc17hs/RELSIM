41|1|Ha'. Mim.
41|2|This is a revelation from the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate,
41|3|a Book whose verses have been well-expounded; an Arabic Qur'an for those who have knowledge,
41|4|one bearing good news and warning. Yet most of them turned away and are not wont to give heed.
41|5|They say: “Our hearts are securely wrapped up against what you call us to, and in our ears is a heaviness, and between you and us there is a veil. So act; we too are acting.”
41|6|Tell them, (O Prophet): “I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your God is One God; so direct yourselves straight to Him, and seek His forgiveness. Woe to those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity,
41|7|who do not pay Zakah, and who deny the Hereafter.
41|8|As to those who have faith and do good works, surely theirs shall be a never-ending reward.
41|9|Tell them, (O Prophet): “Do you indeed disbelieve in Him and assign compeers to Him Who created the earth in two days? He is the Lord of all beings of the Universe.
41|10|(After creating the earth) He set up firm mountains on it, blessed it, and provided it with sustenance in proportion to the needs of all who seek (sustenance). All this was done in four days.
41|11|Then He turned to the heaven while it was all smoke. He said to the heaven and the earth: “Come (into being), willingly or unwillingly.” They said: “Here we come (into being) in willing obeisance.”
41|12|Then He made them seven heavens in two days and revealed to each heaven its law. And We adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and firmly secured it. All this is the firm plan of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.
41|13|But if they turn away, tell them: “I warn you against a sudden scourge like that which struck Ad and Thamud.”
41|14|When the Messengers (of Allah) came to them from the front and from the rear, saying: “Do not serve any but Allah”; they said: “Had our Lord so willed, He would have sent down angels. So we deny the Message you have brought.”
41|15|As for Ad, they waxed proud in the land without justification and said: “Who is greater than we in strength?” Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, is greater in strength than they? They continued to deny Our Signs,
41|16|whereupon We sent upon them a fierce wind on inauspicious days that We might make them taste a degrading chastisement in the life of this world. And surely the chastisement of the Hereafter is even more degrading. There will be none to help them there.
41|17|As for Thamud, We bestowed guidance upon them, but they preferred to remain blind rather than be guided. At last a humiliating scourge overtook them on account of their misdeeds.
41|18|Yet We delivered those who believed and were God-fearing.
41|19|Imagine the Day when Allah's enemies will be mustered to the Fire, and the people of the former times will be detained until the arrival of people of the later times,
41|20|and when all have arrived, their ears, their eyes, and their skins shall bear witness against them, stating all that they had done in the life of the world.
41|21|They will ask their skins: “Why did you bear witness against us?” The skins will reply: “Allah gave us speech, as He gave speech to all others. He it is Who created you for the first time and it is to Him that you will be sent back.
41|22|When you used to conceal yourselves (while committing misdeeds) you never thought that your ears or your eyes or your skins would ever bear witness against you; you rather fancied that Allah does not know a great deal of what you do.
41|23|This thought of yours about your Lord has led to your perdition and you have become among the losers.”
41|24|In this state, whether they bear with patience (or not), Fire alone shall be their abode. And if they seek to make amends, they will not be allowed to do so.
41|25|We had assigned to them companions who embellished for them all that was before them and behind them. Thus the same decree (of chastisement) which had overtaken the previous generations of jinn and human beings (also) became due against them. Surely they became the losers.
41|26|The deniers of the Truth say: “Do not give ear to the Qur'an and cause interruption when it is recited; thus perhaps you will gain the upper hand.”
41|27|We shall certainly make these unbelievers taste a terrible chastisement and shall fully requite them according to the worst deeds that they committed.
41|28|That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah -- the Fire, their abiding home. That will be the re-compense for their denying Our Signs.
41|29|There the unbelievers will say: “Our Lord, show us those that led us astray, both jinn and humans, and we will trample them under our feet so that they are utterly degraded.”
41|30|Those who say “Allah is our Lord” and then remain steadfast, upon them descend angels (and say): “Do not fear nor grieve, and receive good tidings of Paradise which you were promised.
41|31|We are your companions in this world and in the Hereafter. There you shall have all that you desire and all what you will ask for.
41|32|This is by way of hospitality from Him Who is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
41|33|And who is fairer in speech than he who calls to Allah and acts righteously and says: “I am a Muslim”?
41|34|(O Prophet), good and evil are not equal. Repel (evil) with that which is good, and you will see that he, between whom and you there was enmity, shall become as if he were a bosom friend (of yours).
41|35|But none attains to this except those who are steadfast; none attains to this except those endowed with mighty good fortune.
41|36|And if you are prompted by a provocation from Satan, seek refuge with Allah. He, and He alone, is All-Hearing, All- Knowing.
41|37|And of His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate yourselves before the sun, nor before the moon, but prostrate yourselves before Allah Who created them, if it is Him that you serve.
41|38|But if they wax proud (and persist in their attitude, it does not matter, for) the angels near-stationed to your Lord glorify Him night and day, and never grow weary.
41|39|And of His Signs is that you see the earth withered, then We send down water upon it, and lo! it quivers and swells. Surely He Who gives life to the dead earth will also give life to the dead. Surely He has power over everything.
41|40|Those who pervert Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Is he who will be cast into the Fire better, or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you wish; He sees all what you do.
41|41|These are the ones who rejected the Good Counsel when it came to them, although it is certainly a Mighty Book.
41|42|Falsehood may not enter it from the front or from the rear. It is a revelation that has been sent down from the Most Wise, the Immensely Praiseworthy.
41|43|(O Prophet), nothing is said to you but what was already said to the Messengers before you. Surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness and the Lord of grievous chastisement.
41|44|Had We revealed this as a non-Arabic Qur'an they would have said: “Why were its verses not clearly expounded? How strange, a non-Arabic scripture and an Arab audience!” Tell them: “It is a guidance and a healing to the believers. But to those who do not believe, it serves as a plug in their ears and a covering over their eyes. It is as if they are being called from a place far away.
41|45|And in the past We gave Moses the Book and yet it became an object of dispute. If your Lord's decree had not gone forth before, a decisive judgement would have been made among them, once and for all. Surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.
41|46|Whoever does good, does so to his own benefit; and whoever does evil, will suffer its evil consequence. Your Lord does no wrong to His servants.
41|47|The knowledge of the Hour rests solely with Him. Not a fruit comes forth from its sheath, nor does any female conceive nor give birth to a child but it is in His knowledge. On that Day He will call out to them: “Where are those associates of Mine?” They will answer: “We have declared to You that none of us can bear witness to that.”
41|48|Then all those deities whom they once used to call upon shall vanish and they will come to know for sure that there is no escape for them.
41|49|Man wearies not of praying for good, but when evil visits him, he despairs and gives up all hope.
41|50|And if We bestow Our Mercy upon him after hardship, he will surely say: “This is what I truly deserve, and I do not believe that the Hour (of Resurrection) will ever come to pass; and if I am returned to my Lord, there too I shall enjoy the best.” Surely We shall fully apprise the unbelievers of what they have done, and We shall certainly make them taste a severe chastisement.
41|51|When We bestow Our favour upon man, he turns away and waxes proud; but when a misfortune touches him, he is full of supplication.
41|52|Tell them, (O Prophet): “Did you ever consider: if this Qur'an is indeed from Allah and you still deny it, who can be in greater error than he who goes far in fiercely opposing it?”
41|53|Soon shall We show them Our Signs on the horizons and in their own beings until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a witness over everything?
41|54|Lo, they are in doubt concerning their meeting with their Lord. Surely He fully encompasses everything.
42|1|Ha'. Mim.
42|2|Ayn. Sin. Qaf.
42|3|Thus does Allah, the Most Mighty, the Most Wise reveal to you even as (He revealed) to those (Messengers) who preceded you.
42|4|His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; He is the Most High, the All-Great.
42|5|The heavens may well nigh rend asunder from above while the angels proclaim the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Lo, it is Allah, and He alone, Who is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
42|6|Those who have taken others than Him as their protectors beside Him, it is Allah Who oversees them; you are no guardian over them.
42|7|And thus did We reveal this Arabic Qur'an to you that you may warn the people of the Mother of Cities (to wit, Makkah) and those who dwell around it; and warn them of the Day of Gathering concerning which there is no doubt: whereon some will be in Paradise, and some in the Blazing Fire.
42|8|If Allah had so willed, He could have made them all a single community. But He admits whomsoever He pleases into His Mercy. As to those given to wrong-doing, they shall have none as protector or helper.
42|9|(Are they so foolish that) they have chosen others rather than Allah as their protectors? Yet it is Allah Who is the Protector and Who resurrects the dead and Who has power over everything.
42|10|The judgement on whatever you differ rests with Allah. Such is Allah, my Lord; in Him I have put all my trust and to Him I always turn in devotion.
42|11|The Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has appointed for you pairs of your own kind, and pairs also of cattle. Thus does He multiply you. Naught in the universe is like Him. He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
42|12|His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlarges and straitens the sustenance of whomsoever He pleases. Surely He has knowledge of everything.
42|13|He has prescribed for you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad), and which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, commanding: “Establish this religion and do not split up regarding it.” What you are calling to is very hard upon those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity. Allah chooses for Himself whomsoever He pleases and guides to Himself whoever penitently turns to Him.
42|14|They did not split up except after knowledge had come to them, and then only because they wished to commit excesses against each other. Had your Lord not already decreed that judgement would be made later at an appointed time, the matter between them would surely have been decided once and for all. Indeed those who were later made the heirs of the Book are in disquieting doubt about it.
42|15|(This being so, O Muhammad), call people to the same religion and be steadfast about it as you were commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say (to them): “I believe in the Book Allah has sent down. I have been commanded to establish justice among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us all together. To Him all are destined to return.”
42|16|Those who contend concerning Allah (after His call has been responded to), their contention is absolutely void in the sight of their Lord. Allah's wrath is upon them and a grievous chastisement awaits them.
42|17|Allah it is Who sent down this Book with the Truth and the Balance. And what would make you know that the Hour (of Judgement) has drawn near?
42|18|Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten its coming. But those who believe (in it) hold it in dread and know that the Hour (of Judgement) is bound to come. Lo, those who dispute concerning the coming of the Hour are gone far in error.
42|19|Allah is Most Gentle to His servants and grants sustenance to whomsoever He pleases. He is All-Strong, Most Mighty.
42|20|Whoever seeks the harvest of the Hereafter, We shall increase for him his harvest, and whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We shall give him thereof; but he will have no share in the Hereafter.
42|21|Do they have any associates (of Allah) who have laid down for them a way pertaining to faith which Allah did not sanction? But for the fact that a decree had already been made, the matter between them would have been decided once and for all. Surely a grievous chastisement awaits the wrong-doers.
42|22|You will see the wrongdoers fearful of the consequence of their deeds which will certainly overtake them. But those who have faith and do good deeds will be in the meadows of the Gardens, wherein they shall have whatever they desire from their Lord; that is the great Bounty.
42|23|That is the Bounty of which Allah gives tidings to His servants who have faith and do good deeds. Tell them, (O Prophet): “I do not ask you for any recompense for my work except love towards kinsfolk.” Whoever does a good deed, We shall increase its merit for him. Surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
42|24|Do they say: “He has forged a lie against Allah?” If Allah so wanted He could seal up your heart. Allah blots out falsehood and confirms the truth by His Words. He is well aware of all the secrets hidden in the breasts (of people).
42|25|He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins and knows all what you do,
42|26|and answers the prayers of those who believe and do good deeds and bestows upon them even more out of His Bounty. As for those who deny (the Truth), a grievous chastisement awaits them.
42|27|If Allah were to grant ample sustenance to His servants they would go about transgressing in the land. But He sends down in due measure whatever (sustenance) He wills. Surely He is Well-Aware and All-Seeing concerning matters that relate to His servants.
42|28|He it is Who sends down the rain after they despair of it, spreading out His Mercy. He is the Protector, the Immensely Praiseworthy.
42|29|And of His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures that He has spread out in them. He has the power to bring them together when He so wills.
42|30|Whatever misfortune befalls you is a consequence of your own deeds. But much of it He forgives.
42|31|You cannot frustrate Him in the earth; you have no protector nor helper against Allah.
42|32|And of His Signs are the ships that sail in the sea like mountains.
42|33|If He so wills, He can cause the winds to become still so that they will remain motionless on its surface. Surely there are many Signs in this for those who are wont to be steadfast and give thanks.
42|34|He may, while forgiving much of the sins of those that ride these ships, drown them on account of some of their misdeeds.
42|35|Then those who wrangle about Our Signs will come to know that there is no escape for them.
42|36|That which has been given to you is only the wherewithal of the transient life of this world. But that which is with Allah is better and more enduring for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;
42|37|who eschew grave sins and shameful deeds, and whenever they are angry, forgive;
42|38|who obey their Lord and establish Prayer; who conduct their affairs by consultation, and spend out of what We have bestowed upon them;
42|39|who, when a wrong is done to them, seek its redress.
42|40|The recompense of evil is evil the like of it. But he who forgives and makes amends, his reward lies with Allah. Surely He does not love the wrong-doers.
42|41|There is no blame against him who avenges himself after he has been wronged.
42|42|Blame attaches only to those who subject people to wrong and commit excesses on earth. A painful chastisement awaits them.
42|43|But he who patiently endures and forgives, that is a conduct of great resolve.
42|44|He whom Allah lets go astray, none after Him can be his protector. You will see that when the wrong-doers observe the chastisement, they will exclaim: “Is there any way to go back?”
42|45|You shall see them, as they are brought face to face with the chastisement, in a state of abject humiliation, looking with a furtive glance. But the believers will say: “Surely the true losers are they who lose themselves and their kindred on the Day of Resurrection.” Lo, the wrong-doers will be in an enduring torment.
42|46|They shall have no protectors to help them against Allah. For he whom Allah causes to go astray will have no way to save himself.
42|47|Accept the command of your Lord before there comes a Day from Allah that cannot be averted. On that Day there shall be no shelter for you, and none may change your predicament.
42|48|(O Prophet), if they turn away from the Truth, know that We did not send you to them as their overseer. Your task is only to convey (the Message). Indeed when We give man a taste of Our Mercy, he exults in it. But if any misfortune afflicts them on account of their deeds, man is utterly ungrateful.
42|49|The dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. He creates whatever He pleases. He grants females to whomever He pleases and males to whomever He pleases,
42|50|or grants them a mix of males and females, and causes whomever He pleases to be barren. He is All- Knowing, All-Powerful.
42|51|It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him except through revelation, or from behind a veil, or that a messenger (an angel) be sent to him who reveals to him by Allah's leave whatever He wishes. He is All-High, Most Wise.
42|52|Even so We revealed to you, (O Prophet), a spirit by Our command. (Ere to that) you knew neither what the Book nor what the faith was. But We made that spirit a light whereby We guide those of Our servants whom We please to the Right Way. Surely you are directing people to the Right Way,
42|53|the Way of Allah, to Whom belongs the dominion of all that is in the heavens and the earth. Lo, it is to Allah that all things ultimately revert.
43|1|Ha'. Mim.
43|2|By the Clear Book;
43|3|verily We have made it an Arabic Qur'an that you may understand.
43|4|Indeed it is transcribed in the Original Book with Us; sublime and full of wisdom.
43|5|Should We divert this Good Counsel from you because you are a people immersed in extravagance?
43|6|How many a Prophet did We send to the earlier peoples!
43|7|Yet never did a Prophet come to them but they mocked him.
43|8|We utterly destroyed them although they were greater in might than these. The examples of ancient peoples have gone before.
43|9|Yet if you were to ask them: “Who created the heavens and the earth?” they will certainly say: “The All-Mighty, the All-Knowing has created them.”
43|10|He it is Who made this earth for you a cradle and made in it pathways for you that you may find the way to your destination;
43|11|He Who sent down water from the sky in a determined measure, and thereby We revived a dead land: likewise will you be raised up (from the earth) --
43|12|He Who created these pairs, all of them, and provided you ships and cattle on which you ride,
43|13|so that when you are mounted upon them you may remember the bounty of your Lord, and say: “Glory be to Him Who has subjected this to Us whereas we did not have the strength to subdue it.
43|14|It is to our Lord that we shall eventually return.”
43|15|Yet they have made some of His servants a part of Him. Indeed man is most evidently thankless.
43|16|Has Allah taken for Himself daughters out of those whom He creates and has chosen you to have sons?
43|17|(They believe so although when) any of them is given tidings of the birth of a female child the like of which he assigns to the Merciful One, his countenance darkens and he is choked with grief.
43|18|Do they assign to Allah one who grows up amidst ornaments and is not well-versed in the art of disputation?
43|19|They claim that angels, who are Allah's chosen servants, are females. Did they witness how their body is constituted? Their testimony shall be written and they shall be called to account.
43|20|They say: “Had the Merciful One so willed, we would never have worshipped these deities.” But they have no knowledge of the matter and are simply conjecturing.
43|21|Or did We bestow upon them a Book before on whose authority they are holding on (to angel-worship)?
43|22|Nay; they simply claim: “We found our forefathers on a way, and we continue to find guidance in their footsteps.”
43|23|And thus it is: whenever We sent any warner to a city its affluent ones said: “We found our forefathers on a way and we continue to follow in their footsteps.”
43|24|Each Prophet asked them: “Will you do so even if we were to show you a way better than the way of your forefathers?” They answered: “We disbelieve in the religion with which you have been sent.”
43|25|Then We exacted retribution from them. So do consider the end of those who gave the lie (to the Prophets).
43|26|Call to mind when Abraham said to his father and his people: “I totally disown all whom you serve
43|27|except the One Who created me; and, behold, it is He Who will direct me to the Right Way.”
43|28|And Abraham left behind this word to endure among his posterity so that they may return to it.
43|29|(Even when they began worshipping others than Allah We did not destroy them) but bestowed sustenance on them and on their forefathers until there came to them the Truth and a Messenger who clearly expounded things to them.
43|30|And when the Truth came to them they said: “This is just sorcery and we reject it.”
43|31|They say: “Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon some great man from the two (main) cities?”
43|32|Is it they who distribute the Mercy of your Lord? It is We Who have distributed their livelihood among them in the life of this world, and have raised some above others in rank that some of them may harness others to their service. Your Lord's Mercy is better than all the treasures that they hoard.
43|33|Were it not that all mankind would become a single community (and follow the same way), We would have provided for all those who disbelieve in the Merciful One silver roofs for their houses, and (silver) stairs on which to go up,
43|34|and (silver) doors to their houses, and couches (of silver) upon which they would recline;
43|35|or that they be made of gold. Surely all this is only the enjoyment of the life of the world. But (true prosperity) in the Hereafter with Your Lord is only for the God-fearing.
43|36|He who is negligent to remember the Merciful One, to him We assign a satan as his boon companion,
43|37|and these satans hinder them from the Right Path, while he still reckons himself to be rightly-guided.
43|38|But when he comes to Us, he will say (to his satan): “Would that there had been between me and you the distance as between the East and the West. How evil a companion you were!”
43|39|(He will then be told): “Today it will not benefit you the least that after your wrong-doing you and your satans now share the chastisement.”
43|40|Can you, (O Prophet), then make the deaf hear, or direct to the Right Way the blind or one lost in manifest error?
43|41|We shall inflict retribution on them, whether We take you away from the world (before We do that),
43|42|or make you see the end that We had promised them, for We have full power over them.
43|43|So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. Surely you are on the Straight Way.
43|44|Verily it is a great source of eminence for you and your people, and soon you will be called to account concerning that.
43|45|Ask all Our Messengers whom We sent before you whether We had appointed any deities beside the Merciful One to be worshipped.
43|46|Indeed We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his nobles. He told them: “I am a Messenger of the Lord of the Universe.”
43|47|Yet when he brought forth Clear Signs from Us, then lo, they burst into laughter.
43|48|Every Sign that We showed them was greater than its predecessor; and then We seized them with Our chastisement so that they may return (to the Right Way).
43|49|(Whenever they faced an affliction) they would say: “O magician, pray for us to your Lord according to your station with Him. We shall certainly be guided to the Right Way.”
43|50|But lo, each time We removed Our affliction from them, they would go back on their word.
43|51|And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people: “My people, do I not have dominion over Egypt, and are these streams not flowing beneath me? Can't you see?
43|52|Am I better or this contemptible man who is scarcely able to express himself?
43|53|Why were bracelets of gold not bestowed upon him? Why did a retinue of angels not accompany him as attendants?”
43|54|He incited his people to levity and they obeyed him. Surely they were an iniquitous people.
43|55|So when they incurred Our wrath, We exacted retribution from them, and drowned them all,
43|56|and made them a thing of the past and an example for those who would come after them.
43|57|No sooner the example of the son of Mary was mentioned than, lo and behold, your people raised a clamour
43|58|and said: “Who is better, our deities or he?” They said so only out of contentiousness. They are a disputatious people.
43|59|He was no more than a servant (of Ours), one upon whom We bestowed Our favours and whom We made an example (of Our infinite power) for the Children of Israel.
43|60|If We had so willed We could have made some of you into angels to become your successors on earth.
43|61|Verily he [i.e., Jesus) is a portent of the Hour. So be in no doubt concerning it and follow Me. This is the Straight Way.
43|62|Let not Satan hinder you (from believing in the Hour), for surely he is your open enemy.
43|63|When Jesus came with Clear Signs and said: “I have brought wisdom to you that I may make plain to you some of the things you differ about. So fear Allah and follow me.
43|64|Allah is my Lord and your Lord; therefore, serve Him. That is the Straight Way.”
43|65|Then the factions fell apart among themselves. So woe to the wrong-doers from the chastisement of a grievous Day.
43|66|Are they awaiting anything other than the Last Hour that it should suddenly come upon them without their even perceiving it?
43|67|On that Day even bosom friends shall become enemies to one another, all except the God-fearing.
43|68|(It will be said to them): “My servants, today you have nothing to fear or regret,
43|69|you who believed in Our Signs and had surrendered yourselves (to Us)!
43|70|Enter Paradise joyfully, both you and your spouses.”
43|71|Platters and cups of gold shall be passed around them, and there shall be all that they might desire and all that their eyes might delight in. (They shall be told): “Herein shall you abide for ever.
43|72|Such is the Paradise that you shall inherit by virtue of your good deeds in the life of the world.
43|73|Herein you will have abundant fruits of which you will eat.”
43|74|But the evil-doers shall abide in the torment of Hell.
43|75|Never will their torment be lightened for them. They shall remain in utter despair.
43|76|It is not We Who wronged them; rather, it is they who wronged themselves.
43|77|They shall call out: “O Malik, let your Lord put an end to us.” He will reply: “You must stay on in it.
43|78|We brought you the Truth; but to the truth most of you were averse.”
43|79|Have they contrived some scheme? If so, We too will contrive a scheme.
43|80|Or do they think that We do not hear their secret talks and their whispering counsels? Yes, indeed We do and Our messengers [i.e., angels) are with them, writing.
43|81|Say: “If the Merciful One had a son, I would have been the first one to worship him.”
43|82|Exalted be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, above what they attribute to Him.
43|83|So leave them alone to indulge in their vanities and to frolic about until they encounter that Day of theirs against which they have been warned.
43|84|He it is Who is God in the heavens and the earth. He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing.
43|85|Blessed is He Who has dominion over the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. With Him is the knowledge of the Hour; and to Him you shall all be sent back.
43|86|Those whom they call upon, instead of Allah have no power of intercession, except such that testify to the truth based on knowledge.
43|87|If you were to ask them: “Who created them?” they will surely say: “Allah.” Whence are they, then, being led astray?
43|88|We call to witness the cry of the Messenger: “O Lord, these are a people not wont to believe!”
43|89|Indulge them, (O Prophet), and say to them: “Peace to you.” For soon they shall come to know.
44|1|Ha'. Mim.
44|2|By the Clear Book.
44|3|We revealed it on a Blessed Night, for We were intent on warning;
44|4|(We revealed it on the Night) wherein every matter is wisely determined
44|5|by Our command. Verily, We were set to send a Messenger
44|6|as a Mercy from your Lord. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing,
44|7|the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them: if you would only have sure faith.
44|8|There is no god but He: He gives life and causes death. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of yore.
44|9|(But the fact is, they lack certainty) and frolic about in doubt.
44|10|So watch for the Day when the sky will come down with a pall of smoke,
44|11|enveloping people. That will be a grievous scourge.
44|12|(People will then say): “Our Lord, remove this scourge from us; we shall believe.”
44|13|But how will they take heed? Such are they that a Messenger came to them clearly expounding the Truth,
44|14|yet they turned away from him and said: “This is a well-tutored madman.”
44|15|Yet We will hold the scourge back for a while, (but no sooner than We will do so) you will revert to your old ways.
44|16|The Day when We shall seize them with a mighty seizing, that will be the Day on which We shall inflict upon you full retribution.
44|17|Indeed before that We subjected the Pharaonites to the same test. A noble Messenger came to them
44|18|(and said): “Deliver to me Allah's servants. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you,
44|19|and do not exalt yourselves in defiance of Allah. I have come to you with a clear authority (as a Messenger).
44|20|I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you should attack me with stones.
44|21|But if you do not believe what I say, leave me alone (and desist from laying hands on me).”
44|22|Then he called upon his Lord: “These are a criminal people.”
44|23|(He was told): “Set out with My servants by night for you will certainly be pursued.
44|24|And leave the sea behind you as calm as ever. Surely they are an army that is doomed to be drowned.”
44|25|How many gardens did they leave behind, and how many fountains
44|26|and sown fields and splendid mansions,
44|27|and the life of ease in which they took delight!
44|28|Thus it was; and We made another people inherit all that.
44|29|Then neither the sky shed tears over them nor the earth. They were granted no respite.
44|30|Thus did We deliver the Children of Israel from the humiliating chastisement,
44|31|from Pharaoh who was most prominent among the prodigals.
44|32|We knowingly exalted them (i.e., the Children of Israel) above other peoples of the world
44|33|and bestowed upon them the Signs wherein lay an evident test for them.
44|34|Indeed these people say:
44|35|“This is our first and only death, and we shall never be raised again.
44|36|Bring back to us our fathers if you are truthful.”
44|37|Are these better or the people of Tubba and those who went before them? We destroyed them for they were a criminal people.
44|38|It was not in idle sport that We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them.
44|39|We did not create them except in Truth. But most of them do not know.
44|40|The Day of Final Decision is the appointed time for all;
44|41|the Day when a friend shall be of no avail to his friend nor shall they be helped,
44|42|except those to whom Allah shows mercy. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Compassionate.
44|43|The tree of al-Zaqqum
44|44|shall be the food of the sinful.
44|45|Like dregs of oil, it will boil in their bellies
44|46|like boiling water.
44|47|“Seize him and drag him to the middle of the Blazing Fire,
44|48|then pour boiling water over his head as chastisement.
44|49|Taste this, you are a person mighty and noble!
44|50|This is what you used to doubt.”
44|51|Verily the God-fearing shall be in a secure place
44|52|amidst gardens and springs.
44|53|Attired in silk and brocade, they shall be arrayed face to face.
44|54|Thus shall it be: and We shall espouse them to fair, wide-eyed maidens.
44|55|While resting in security, they shall call for all kinds of fruit.
44|56|They shall not taste death except the death in this world. And Allah will save them from the chastisement of Hell
44|57|as a favour from your Lord. That is the great triumph.
44|58|(O Prophet), We have made this Book easy in your tongue so that they may take heed.
44|59|Wait, then; they too are waiting.
45|1|Ha'. Mim.
45|2|This Book is a revelation from the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
45|3|Behold, for those who believe there are (myriad) Signs in the heavens and the earth
45|4|and in your own creation; and in the animals which He spreads out over the earth too there are Signs for those endowed with sure faith;
45|5|and in the succession of night and day, and in the provision that Allah sends down from the sky wherewith He gives life to the earth after it had been lifeless, and in the change of the winds: (in all these) there are Signs for people who use reason.
45|6|These are Allah's Signs that We rehearse to you in Truth. In what kind of discourse after Allah and His Signs will they, then, believe?
45|7|Woe to every guilty impostor
45|8|who hears Allah's Signs being rehearsed to him, and yet persists in his pride, as though he had not heard it. Announce to him, then, the tidings of a grievous chastisement.
45|9|Whenever he comes to know anything of Our Signs, he makes them an object of jest. For such there awaits a humiliating chastisement.
45|10|Hell is behind them. Their worldly earnings shall not avail them, nor those whom they took as protectors instead of Allah. An awesome chastisement lies in store for them.
45|11|This (Qur'an) is the true guidance. Those who deny the Signs of their Lord shall suffer the torment of a woeful scourge.
45|12|Allah it is Who has subjected the sea to you so that ships may sail upon it at His bidding and you may seek of His Bounty and give thanks to Him.
45|13|He has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and the earth, all being from Him. Verily there are Signs in this for those who reflect.
45|14|(O Prophet), tell the believers to indulge those who have no fear of any evil days coming upon them from Allah so that Allah may Himself requite them for their deeds.
45|15|Whoever acts righteously, does so to his own good; and whoever commits an evil will suffer its consequence. All of you will then be sent back to your Lord.
45|16|Indeed We endowed the Children of Israel with the Book and Wisdom and Prophethood, and provided them with good things as sustenance, and exalted them above the peoples of the whole world.
45|17|We gave them clear directions in matters pertaining to religion. Yet they differed among themselves (not out of ignorance but) after knowledge had come to them; and they did so out of the desire to commit excesses against one another. On the Day of Resurrection Allah will judge among them regarding what they had differed.
45|18|And then We set you, (O Prophet), on a clear high road in religious matters. So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know.
45|19|Surely they will be of no avail to you against Allah. Indeed the wrong-doers are friends of each other, whereas Allah is the friend of the God-fearing.
45|20|These are the lights of discernment for people and guidance and mercy for those endowed with sure faith.
45|21|Do the evil-doers imagine that We shall make them equal to those who believe and do good, making their lives and deaths alike? How vile is their judgement!
45|22|Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth that each person may be requited for his deeds. They shall not be wronged.
45|23|Did you ever consider the case of him who took his desire as his god, and then Allah caused him to go astray despite knowledge, and sealed his hearing and his heart, and cast a veil over his sight? Who, after Allah, can direct him to the Right Way? Will you not take heed?
45|24|They say: “There is no life other than our present worldly life: herein we live and we die, and it is only (the passage of) time that destroys us. Yet the fact is that they know nothing about this and are only conjecturing.
45|25|And when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, their only contention is: “Bring back to us our fathers if you are truthful.”
45|26|Tell them, (O Prophet): “It is Allah Who gives you life and then causes you to die, and He it is Who will then bring all of you together on the Day of Resurrection, a Day regarding which there can be no doubt. Yet most people do not know.
45|27|Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and on the Day when the Hour (of Resurrection) shall come to pass, the followers of falsehood shall be in utter loss.
45|28|On that Day you shall see every people fallen on their knees. Every people will be summoned to come forth and see its Record and will be told: “Today you shall be requited for your deeds.
45|29|This is Our Record which bears witness against you with truth; We used to record all what you did.”
45|30|As for those who believe and act righteously, their Lord shall admit them to His Mercy. That indeed is the manifest triumph.
45|31|But those who denied the Truth, they shall be told: “Were My Signs not rehearsed to you? But you waxed proud and became a guilty people.”
45|32|And when it was said to them: “Surely Allah's promise is true, and there is no doubt regarding the Hour of Resurrection,” you were wont to say: “We do not know what the Hour (of Resurrection) is. We are simply making conjectures and are not at all certain.”
45|33|(On that Day) the evil of their deeds will become apparent to them and what they had mocked at will encompass them,
45|34|and it will be said: “We will forget you today as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours. The Fire shall now be your abode, and you shall have none to come to your aid.
45|35|You reached this end because you made Allah's Signs an object of jest and the life of the world deluded you.” So they shall not be taken out of the Fire nor shall they be asked to make amends (and thus please their Lord).
45|36|So all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the whole Universe.
45|37|His is the glory in the heavens and the earth. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
46|1|Ha'. Mim.
46|2|The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
46|3|We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in Truth and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve have turned away from what they were warned against.
46|4|Tell them, (O Prophet): “Did you consider those whom you call upon beside Allah? Show me, which part of the earth they created? Or do they have any share in creating the heavens? Bring to me any Scripture earlier than this one, or any vestige of knowledge (in support of your belief) if you are truthful.
46|5|Who is farther strayed from the Right Path than he who calls upon others than Allah that cannot answer his call till the Day of Resurrection, the while they are not even conscious that callers are calling upon them?
46|6|When all human beings will be gathered together those who had been called upon will become the enemies to their votaries and will disown their worship.
46|7|When Our Clear Messages are rehearsed to them, the unbelievers exclaim about the Truth when it came to them: “This is plain sorcery.”
46|8|Do they claim that the Messenger himself has fabricated it? (If so), tell them: “If I have fabricated it, then you have no power to protect me from Allah's chastisement. He knows well the idle talk in which you indulge. He suffices as a witness between me and you. He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
46|9|Tell them: “I am not the first of the Messengers; and I do not know what shall be done with me or with you. I follow only what is revealed to me, and I am nothing but a plain warner.”
46|10|Tell them, (O Prophet): “Did you consider (what would be your end) if this Qur'an were indeed from Allah and yet you rejected it? And this even though a witness from the Children of Israel has testified to the like of it. But he believed, while you waxed arrogant. Verily Allah does not guide such wrong-doers to the Right Way.
46|11|The unbelievers say to the believers: If there was any good in this Book, others would not have beaten us to its acceptance.” But since they have not been guided to it, they will certainly say: “This is an old fabrication.”
46|12|Yet before this the Book was revealed to Moses as a guide and a mercy. This Book, which confirms it, is in the Arabic tongue to warn the wrong-doers and to give good tidings to those who do good.
46|13|Surely those who said: “Our Lord is Allah” and then remained steadfast shall have nothing to fear nor to grieve.
46|14|They are the people of Paradise. They shall remain in it forever as a reward for their deeds.
46|15|We have enjoined man to be kind to his parents. In pain did his mother bear him and in pain did she give birth to him. The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months. And when he is grown to full maturity and reaches the age of forty, he prays: “My Lord, dispose me that I may give thanks for the bounty that You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and dispose me that I may do righteous deeds that would please You, and also make my descendants righteous. I repent to You, and I am one of those who surrender themselves to You.”
46|16|Such are those from whom We accept their best deeds and whose evil deeds We overlook. They will be among the people of Paradise in consonance with the true promise made to them.
46|17|But he who says to his parents: “Fie on you! Do you threaten me that I shall be resurrected, although myriad generations have passed away before me (and not one of them was resurrected)?” The parents beseech Allah (and say to their child): “Woe to you, have faith. Surely Allah's promise is true.” But he says: “All this is nothing but fables of olden times.”
46|18|It is against such that Allah's sentence (of punishment) has become due. They will join the communities of humans and jinn that have preceded them. Verily all of them will court utter loss.
46|19|Of these all have ranks according to their deeds so that Allah may fully recompense them for their deeds. They shall not be wronged.
46|20|And on the Day when the unbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, they will be told: “You have exhausted your share of the bounties in the life of the world, and you took your fill of enjoyments. So, degrading chastisement shall be yours on this Day for you waxed arrogant in the earth without justification and acted iniquitously.”
46|21|Recount to them the story of (Hud), the brother of (the tribe of) 'Ad. Hud warned his people beside the sand-dunes -- and there have been other warners before him and since his time -- saying: “Serve none but Allah. Verily I fear that the chastisement of an awesome day shall come upon you.”
46|22|They said: “Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods? Then, bring upon us the scourge that you threaten us with. Do so if you are truthful.”
46|23|He replied: “Allah alone knows about this. I only convey to you the Message that I have been sent with. But I see that you are an ignorant people.”
46|24|When they saw the scourge advancing towards their valleys, they said: “This is a cloud that will bring much rain to us.” “By no means; it is what you had sought to hasten -- a wind-storm bearing a grievous chastisement
46|25|that will destroy everything by the command of its Lord.” Thereafter nothing was left to be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We requite the wrong-doers.
46|26|We had established them firmly in a manner We have not established you. We had given them ears and eyes and hearts. But nothing availed them -- neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts, for they denied the Signs of Allah. Then what they had mocked at encompassed them.
46|27|Surely We destroyed many a town around you. We sent Our Messages to them repeatedly and in diverse forms that they may eschew (their evil ways) and return (to Allah).
46|28|So why did those whom they had set up as gods apart from Allah, hoping that they would bring them nearer to Him, not come to their aid? Instead, they failed them. This was the end of the lie they had fabricated and the false beliefs they had invented.
46|29|And call to mind when We sent to you a party of the jinn that they may listen to the Qur'an. When they reached the place (where you were reciting the Qur'an), they said to one another: “Be silent (and listen).” And when the recitation ended, they went back to their people as warners.
46|30|They said: “Our people, We have heard a Scripture revealed after Moses, verifying the Scriptures revealed before it; it guides to the Truth and to the Straight Way.
46|31|Our people, respond to the call of him who calls you to Allah and believe in him. Allah will forgive your sins and will protect you from a grievous chastisement.”
46|32|And he who does not respond to the one who calls to Allah will not be able to frustrate Him on earth, nor will they have anyone to protect them from Allah. Such people are in manifest error.
46|33|Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth -- and creating them did not wear Him out -- has the power to bring the dead back to life? Why not! He certainly has the power over everything.
46|34|On the Day when the unbelievers will be brought within sight of the Fire, they will be asked: “Is this not the Truth?” and they will answer “Yes, by Our Lord (this is the Truth).” Allah will say: “Then suffer the chastisement as a requital for your disbelieving.”
46|35|So bear with patience, (O Prophet), even as the Messengers endowed with firmness of resolve (before you) bore with patience, and do not be hasty in their regard. The Day when they see what they had been warned against they will feel as though they had remained in the world no more than an hour of a day. (The Truth has been conveyed.) Will any, then, suffer perdition except those who disobey?
47|1|Allah has caused the works of those who disbelieve and hinder people from the way of Allah to go to waste.
47|2|As for those who attained to faith and did righteous works and believed in what was revealed to Muhammad -- which indeed is the Truth from their Lord -- Allah has remitted their evil deeds and has set their condition right.
47|3|That is because those who disbelieved followed falsehood whereas those who believed followed the Truth that came to them from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth to people parables showing their true state.
47|4|When you meet the unbelievers (in battle), smite their necks until you have crushed them, then bind your captives firmly; thereafter (you are entitled to) set them free, either by an act of grace, or against ransom, until the war ends. That is for you to do. If Allah had so willed, He would have Himself exacted retribution from them. (But He did not do so) that He may test some of you by means of others. As for those who are slain in the way of Allah, He shall never let their works go to waste.
47|5|He will guide them and set their condition right
47|6|and will admit them to Paradise with which He has acquainted them.
47|7|Believers, if you aid Allah, He will come to your aid and will plant your feet firmly.
47|8|As to those who disbelieve, perdition lies in store for them and Allah has reduced their works to nought.
47|9|That was because they were averse to what Allah had revealed; so He let their works go to waste.
47|10|Have they not journeyed through the land to see the end of those who went before them? Allah utterly destroyed them. These unbelievers are doomed to the same end.
47|11|That is because Allah is the Protector of the believers whereas the unbelievers have none to protect them.
47|12|Allah shall admit those who believe and do righteous works to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow. As for the unbelievers, they enjoy the pleasures of this transient life and eat as cattle eat. The Fire shall be their resort.
47|13|(O Prophet), how many are the cities that had greater power than your city that drove you out? We destroyed them and there was none to protect them.
47|14|Then, can he, who is on a Clear Guidance from His Lord, be like him whose evil deeds have been embellished to him, and who pursued their lusts?
47|15|Here is the parable of Paradise which the God-fearing have been promised: in it shall be rivers of incorruptible water, rivers of milk unchanging in taste, and rivers of wine, a delight to those that drink; and rivers of pure honey. In it they will have every kind of fruit as well as forgiveness from their Lord. Can such be like those who will abide in the Fire and will be given a boiling water to drink that will tear their bowels apart?
47|16|Among them some give ear to you. But no sooner do they leave your presence than they ask those endowed with knowledge: “What is it that he said just now?” Such are those whose hearts Allah has sealed and who pursue their lusts.
47|17|As for those who were led to the Guidance, Allah increases them in their guidance and causes them to grow in God-fearing.
47|18|Are they waiting, then, for anything else than the Last Hour to suddenly come upon them? Already some of its tokens have come. But when it does actually come upon them, where will any time be left for them to take heed?
47|19|Know, therefore, (O Prophet), that there is no god but Allah, and ask forgiveness for your shortcomings and also for (the shortcomings of) believing men and believing women. Allah knows the places where you move about and where you dwell.
47|20|The believers used to say: “Why is a surah (that would ordain fighting) not revealed?” But when a definitive surah was revealed wherein fighting was mentioned, you saw that those in whose hearts there was a sickness looked at you as though they were about to faint at the approach of death. Pity on them!
47|21|(They keep affirming their) obedience and saying good words. But when a course of action was clearly determined, it would have been better for them if they had proved true to Allah.
47|22|Now, if you were to turn away, what else can be expected but that you will work corruption in the land and fly at each other's throats?
47|23|It is these upon whom Allah has laid His curse: so He made them deaf and deprived them of their sight.
47|24|Do they, then, not reflect on the Qur'an? Or are there locks on their hearts?
47|25|Certainly those who have turned their backs on the True Guidance after it became manifest to them, Satan has embellished their ways for them and has buoyed them up with false hopes.
47|26|This, because they said to those who are averse to the faith that Allah has revealed: “In some matters we shall obey you.” Allah has full knowledge of their secret parleys.
47|27|But how will they fare when angels will take their souls at death and will carry them, striking their faces and backs?
47|28|That is because they have followed a way that angered Allah, and have been averse to His good pleasure. So He reduced all their works to nought.
47|29|Or do they, in whose hearts there is a sickness, believe that Allah will not bring their failings to light?
47|30|If We were to so will, We could have shown them to you so that you would recognise them by their faces, and you would certainly know them by the manner of their speech. Allah knows all your deeds.
47|31|We shall certainly test you until We know those of you who truly strive and remain steadfast, and will ascertain about you.
47|32|Those who disbelieved and barred others from Allah's Way and opposed the Messenger after the True Guidance had become manifest to them, they shall not be able to cause Allah the least harm; rather, Allah will reduce all their works to nought.
47|33|Believers, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not cause your works to be nullified.
47|34|Verily Allah shall not forgive those who disbelieved and barred others from Allah's Way and clung to their unbelief until their death.
47|35|So, be not faint-hearted and do not cry for peace. You shall prevail. Allah is with you and will not bring your works to nought.
47|36|The life of this world is but sport and amusement. If you believe and are God-fearing, He will grant you your reward, and will not ask you for your possessions.
47|37|If He were to ask you for your possessions and press you (in that regard), you would have grown niggardly, and Allah would have brought your failings to light.
47|38|Behold, you are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's Way, but some of you are niggardly. Whoever is niggardly is in fact niggardly to himself. For Allah is All-Sufficient, whereas it is you who are in need of Him. If you turn away, He will replace you by a people other than you, and they will not be like you.
48|1|(O Prophet), surely We have granted you a clear victory
48|2|so that Allah may forgive you your shortcomings, whether earlier or later, and may complete His favours upon you and guide you to the Straight Way,
48|3|and that Allah may bestow upon you a mighty help.
48|4|He it is Who bestowed inner peace on the hearts of the believers so that they may grow yet more firm in their faith. To Allah belong the legions of the heavens and the earth; Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
48|5|(He did this) to admit the believers, both men and women, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide, and to efface their evil deeds from them. That, in Allah's sight, is the supreme triumph.
48|6|(He also did this) to chastise the hypocrites, both men and women, and those who associate others in His Divinity, both men and women, and who harbour evil thoughts about Allah. They shall be afflicted with misfortune, Allah is wroth with them. He has laid His curse upon them and has prepared for them Hell. What an evil end!
48|7|To Allah belong the legions of the heavens and the earth. Allah is Most Mighty, Most Wise.
48|8|(O Prophet), We have sent you forth as a witness, as a bearer of good news, and as a warner
48|9|so that (all of) you may all believe in Allah and His Messenger, and support him, and revere him, and celebrate Allah's glory, morning and evening.
48|10|Those who swore fealty to you, (O Prophet), in fact swore fealty to Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whoever breaks his covenant breaks it to his own hurt; and whoever fulfils the covenant that he made with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward.
48|11|(O Prophet), the bedouins who were left behind say to you: “We were occupied with our goods and families. So ask forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say to them: “Who can be of any avail to you against Allah if He should intend to cause you any harm or confer upon you any benefit?” Allah is well aware of all that you do.
48|12|(But the truth is not what you say.) You had imagined that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and this notion was embellished in your hearts. You harboured an evil thought, and you are an immensely evil people.”
48|13|As for those who do not believe in Allah and His Messenger, for such unbelievers We have prepared a Blazing Fire.
48|14|To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases. He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
48|15|When you press forth for the spoils, those who were left behind will say: “Let us accompany you.” They want to change the command of Allah. Say to them (in clear words): “You shall not accompany us. Thus has Allah already said.” Then they will say: “Nay; but you are jealous of us.” The truth is that they understand little.
48|16|Say to the bedouins who were left behind: “You will be called against those who possess great might and be asked to fight against them unless they surrender. If you obey (the command to fight), Allah will bestow upon you a goodly reward. But if you turn away, as you turned away before, He shall inflict upon you a grievous chastisement.”
48|17|There is no blame on the blind, nor on the lame, nor on the sick (if they do not go forth to fight). Allah will admit those who obey Allah and His Messenger to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow and will inflict a grievous chastisement on those who turn away.
48|18|Allah was much pleased with the believers when they swore fealty to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts. So He bestowed inner peace upon them and rewarded them with a victory near at hand
48|19|and with abundant spoils which they shall acquire. Allah is Most Mighty, Most Wise.
48|20|Allah has promised you abundant spoils which you shall acquire. He has instantly granted you this (victory) and has restrained the hands of people from you that it may be a Sign for the believers and He may guide you to a Straight Way.
48|21|He also promises you other spoils which you have not yet taken, but Allah has encompassed them. Allah has power over everything.
48|22|Had the unbelievers fought against you at that time, they would have turned their backs (in flight), and would have found none to protect or help them.
48|23|Such is Allah's Way that has come down from the past. Never shall you find any change in the Way of Allah.
48|24|He it is Who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah, even though He had made you victorious against them. Allah was watching all that you did.
48|25|They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Inviolable Mosque and prevented the animals you had designated for sacrifice from reaching the place of their offering. If it had not been for the believing men and believing women (who lived in Makkah and) whom you did not know, and had there not been the fear that you might trample on them and unwittingly incur blame on their account, (then fighting would not have been put to a stop. It was stopped so that) Allah may admit to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases. Had those believers been separated from the rest, We would certainly have inflicted a grievous chastise-ment on those of them [i.e. the Makkans) who disbelieved.
48|26|(This is why) when the unbelievers set in their hearts a fierce bigotry -- the bigotry of ignorance -- Allah bestowed inner peace upon His Messenger and upon the believers and made the word of piety binding on them. They were more deserving and worthier thereof. Allah has knowledge of everything.
48|27|Allah indeed showed His Messenger the true vision, one fully in accord with reality. If Allah so wills you shall certainly enter the Inviolable Mosque, in full security, you will shave your heads and cut your hair short, and do so without any fear. He knew what you did not know, and He granted you a victory near at hand even before (the fulfilment of the vision).
48|28|He it is Who sent His Messenger with the True Guidance and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail over every religion. Sufficient is Allah as a witness (to this).
48|29|Muhammad is Allah's Messenger, and those who are with him are firm with the unbelievers but compassionate with one another. You see them occupied in bowing and prostrating and in seeking Allah's bounty and good pleasure. They are distinguished from others by the marks of prostration on their faces. Thus are they described in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a tilth that puts forth its shoot, then strengthens it so that it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem. This is a sight pleasing to the sowers and one by which the unbelievers will be enraged. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, Allah has promised them forgiveness and a great reward.
49|1|Believers, do not advance before Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah. Verily Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
49|2|Believers, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet and when speaking to him do not speak aloud as you speak aloud to one another, lest all your deeds are reduced to nothing without your even realising it.
49|3|The ones who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah are those whose hearts Allah has tested for God-fearing. Theirs shall be forgiveness and a great reward.
49|4|Surely most of those who call out to you, (O Prophet), from behind the apartments, are devoid of understanding.
49|5|If they were patient until you went out to them, that would have been better for them. Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
49|6|Believers, when an ungodly person brings to you a piece of news, carefully ascertain its truth, lest you should hurt a people unwittingly and thereafter repent at what you did.
49|7|Know that Allah's Messenger is among you. Were he to follow you in many an affair, you yourselves would suffer. But Allah has endeared faith to you and has embellished it in your hearts, and has made unbelief and evil-doing and disobedience abhorrent to you. Such are those who are rightly guided,
49|8|by Allah's favour and bounty. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
49|9|If two parties of the believers happen to fight, make peace between them. But then, if one of them transgresses against the other, fight the one that transgresses until it reverts to Allah's command. And if it does revert, make peace between them with justice, and be equitable for Allah loves the equitable.
49|10|Surely the believers are none but brothers unto one another, so set things right between your brothers, and have fear of Allah that you may be shown mercy.
49|11|Believers, let not a group (of men) scoff at another group, it may well be that the latter (at whom they scoff) are better than they; nor let a group of women scoff at another group, it may well be that the latter are better than they. And do not taunt one another, nor revile one another by nicknames. It is an evil thing to gain notoriety for ungodliness after belief. Those who do not repent are indeed the wrong-doers.
49|12|Believers, avoid being excessively suspicious, for some suspicion is a sin. Do not spy, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would surely detest it. Have fear of Allah. Surely Allah is much prone to accept repentance, is Most Compassionate.
49|13|Human beings, We created you all from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another. Verily the noblest of you in the sight of Allah is the most God-fearing of you. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.
49|14|The Bedouins say: “We believe.” (O Prophet), say to them: “You do not believe; you should rather say: 'We have submitted'”; for belief has not yet entered your hearts. If you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not diminish anything from the reward of any of your deeds. Surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
49|15|Indeed the ones possessed of true faith are those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and then they did not entertain any doubt and strove hard in the Way of Allah with their lives and their possessions. These are the truthful ones.
49|16|Say, (O Prophet), (to these pretenders to faith): “Are you apprising Allah of your faith? Allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth. Allah has full knowledge of everything.”
49|17|They count it as a favour to you that they accepted Islam. Say: “Do not regard your (accepting) Islam as a favour to me; rather, Allah has bestowed a favour on you by guiding you to faith, if you are truthful (in your claim to be believers).
49|18|Surely Allah knows every hidden thing of the heavens and the earth. Allah sees all that you do.
50|1|Qaf. By the glorious Qur'an.
50|2|Nay; they wondered that a warner should have come to them from among themselves. The unbelievers said: “This indeed is a strange thing.
50|3|What! When we are dead and reduced to mere dust, (shall we be raised to life)? Such a return is far-fetched.”
50|4|(Thus do they imagine, although) We know well what the earth takes away from them. With Us is a Record that preserves everything.
50|5|They gave the lie to the Truth when it came to them. So they are now in a state of great perplexity.
50|6|Did they never observe the sky above them: how We built it and beautified it; and it has no cracks;
50|7|and We have spread out the earth, and have set upon it firm mountains, and have caused it to bring out plants of all beauteous kinds?
50|8|All these are to serve as eye openers and as a lesson to every being who is prone to turn (to the Truth).
50|9|We also sent down blessed water from the heaven, wherewith We caused gardens and harvest-grain to grow,
50|10|and tall palm-trees with their thickly-clustered spathes;
50|11|all this as sustenance for Our servants. And thus We do bring the dead land back to life with water. Such shall be the coming forth (of human beings from the earth).
50|12|In the past Noah's people, and the people of Rass and Thamud gave the lie (to Messengers),
50|13|and so did 'Ad, and Pharaoh and Lot's brethren,
50|14|and the people of Aykah, and the people of Tubba'. They all gave the lie to the Messengers. Thereafter My threat of chastisement against them was fulfilled.
50|15|Did We, then, become worn out by the first creation? Not at all; but they are in doubt about a fresh creation.
50|16|Surely We have created man, and We know the promptings of his heart, and We are nearer to him than even his jugular vein.
50|17|Moreover, there are two scribes, one each sitting on the right and the left, recording everything.
50|18|He utters not a word, but there is a vigilant watcher at hand.
50|19|Lo, the agony of death has indeed come with the Truth. That is what you had sought to avoid.
50|20|And then the Trumpet was blown. This is the day of the promised chastisement.
50|21|Everyone has come, each attended by one who will drive him on, and another who will bear witness.
50|22|You were heedless of this. Now We have removed your veil and so your vision today is sharp.
50|23|His companion said: “Here is he who was in my charge.”
50|24|The command was given: “Cast into Hell every hardened, stubborn unbeliever,
50|25|who hinders good, exceeds the limits, is immersed in doubts,
50|26|and has set up another deity with Allah. Hurl him into the grievous torment.”
50|27|His companion said: “I did not incite him to rebel; he was far gone into error of his own accord.”
50|28|(It was said): “Do not remonstrate in My presence. I had warned you.
50|29|My Word is not changed; and never do I inflict the least wrong upon My servants.”
50|30|On that Day We shall ask Hell: “Are you full?” And it will reply: “Are there any more?”
50|31|And when Paradise shall be brought close to the God-fearing, and will no longer be far away,
50|32|it will be said: “This is what you were promised, a promise made to everyone who turned much (to Allah) and was watchful of his conduct,
50|33|to everyone who feared the Merciful One though He is beyond the reach of perception, to everyone who has come with a heart ever wont to turn (to Him).
50|34|Enter this Paradise in peace.” That will be the Day of Eternity.
50|35|Therein they shall get whatever they desire; and with Us there is even more.
50|36|How many a nation did We destroy before them that were stronger in prowess than these. They searched about the lands of the world. But could they find a refuge?
50|37|Verily there is a lesson in this for everyone who has a (sound) heart and who listens with an attentive mind.
50|38|We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and weariness did not even touch Us.
50|39|Hence bear with patience whatever they say, and celebrate your Lord's glory before the rising of the sun and before its setting;
50|40|and in the night, too, celebrate His glory, in the wake of prostration.
50|41|Hearken on the Day when the caller will call from a place nearby,
50|42|the Day when they shall hear the Blast in truth. That will be the Day (for the dead) to come forth.
50|43|Surely it is We Who give life and cause death, and to Us shall all return
50|44|on the Day when the earth will be rent asunder and people, rising from it, will hasten forth. To assemble them all will be easy for Us.
50|45|(O Prophet), We are well aware of what they say; and you are not required to force things on them. So exhort with the Qur'an all those who fear My warning.
51|1|By the winds which scatter dust,
51|2|which carry clouds laden with water,
51|3|which then smoothly speed along,
51|4|and execute the great task of apportioning (rainfall):
51|5|surely what you are being warned against is true,
51|6|and the Judgement shall doubtlessly take place.
51|7|By the heaven with its numerous forms:
51|8|surely you are at variance (about the Hereafter);
51|9|though only those who are averse to the Truth will turn away from (believing in it).
51|10|Doomed are the conjecturers
51|11|who are steeped in ignorance and heedlessness.
51|12|They ask: “When will the Day of Judgement be?”
51|13|It will be the Day when they shall be scourged by the Fire
51|14|(and be told): “Taste your ordeal! This is what you were seeking to hasten.”
51|15|As for the God-fearing, they shall be in the midst of gardens and fountains,
51|16|joyously receiving what their Lord will have granted them. Verily they did good works before (the coming of this Day):
51|17|they used to sleep but little by night,
51|18|and would ask for forgiveness at dawn,
51|19|and in their wealth there was a rightful share for him who would ask and for the destitute.
51|20|There are many Signs on earth for those of sure faith,
51|21|and also in your own selves. Do you not see?
51|22|And in heaven is your provision and also what you are being promised.
51|23|So, by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, this is certainly true, as true as the fact of your speaking.
51|24|(O Prophet), did the story of Abraham's honoured guests reach you?
51|25|When they came to him, they said: “Peace”; he said: “Peace also be to you; (you seem to be) a group of strangers.”
51|26|Then he went back to his family and brought a fat roasted calf
51|27|and laid it before them, saying: “Will you not eat?”
51|28|Then he became afraid of them. They said: “Fear not,” and announced to him the good news of (the birth of) a boy endowed with knowledge.
51|29|So hearing his wife went forth shouting. She struck her face and exclaimed: “A barren old woman am I.”
51|30|They said: “So has your Lord said (that you shall have a boy). Surely He is Most Wise, All-Knowing.”
51|31|Abraham said: “Envoys (of Allah), what is your errand?”
51|32|They replied: “Behold, we have been sent to a wicked people
51|33|that we may unleash a shower of clay-stones
51|34|marked by your Lord upon those who go beyond the limits.”
51|35|Then We evacuated there from all the believers
51|36|– and We did not find there any, apart from a single house of Muslims –
51|37|and We left therein a Sign for those who fear the grievous chastisement.
51|38|There is also a Sign for you in the story of Moses when We sent him with a clear authority to Pharaoh.
51|39|But Pharaoh turned away, showing arrogance on account of his power, and said (about Moses): “He is either a sorcerer or a madman.”
51|40|So We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea. He became an object of much blame.
51|41|There is also a Sign for you in (the story of) Ad, when We let loose upon them an ominous wind
51|42|that left nothing that it came upon without reducing it to rubble.
51|43|There is also a Sign for you in (the story of) Thamud. They were told: “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”
51|44|But they brazenly disobeyed their Lord's command, and then a sudden chastisement overtook them while they looked on.
51|45|They were unable even to stand up or protect themselves.
51|46|Before all these We destroyed the people of Noah: they were a wicked people.
51|47|And heaven – We made it with Our Own Power and We have the Power to do so.
51|48|And the earth – We spread it out, and how well have We smoothed it!
51|49|And of everything We have created pairs; perhaps you will take heed.
51|50|Flee, therefore, to Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him;
51|51|and do not set up any deity with Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him.
51|52|Thus has it been (in the past): never did a Messenger come to the nations that preceded them but they said: “(He is) a sorcerer, or a mad-man.”
51|53|Have they arrived at a common understanding concerning this? No; but they are a people given to transgression.
51|54|So turn your attention away from them; you shall incur no blame.
51|55|Do, however, keep exhorting them; for exhortation benefits those endowed with faith.
51|56|I created the jinn and humans for nothing else but that they may serve Me;
51|57|I desire from them no provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.
51|58|Surely Allah is the Bestower of all provision, the Lord of all power, the Strong.
51|59|The wrong-doers shall receive a portion of the chastisements as their fellows (of yore). So let them not rush Me.
51|60|Woe, then, betide those who disbelieved in that Day of theirs which they are being asked to hold in dread.
52|1|By the Mount,
52|2|and the Book inscribed
52|3|on fine parchment;
52|4|by the much-frequented House,
52|5|by the elevated canopy;
52|6|and by the swelling sea:
52|7|verily your Lord's chastisement shall come to pass,
52|8|none can avert that.
52|9|(It shall come to pass) on the Day when the heaven will convulse in a great convulsion,
52|10|and the mountains shall violently fly about.
52|11|Woe, then, on that Day to those who give the lie (to this Message)
52|12|and amuse themselves with vain argumentation.
52|13|On the Day when they shall be thrust into Hell with a violent thrust (and shall be told):
52|14|“This is the Hell which you used to give the lie to.”
52|15|Is this, then, any feat of magic or are you unable to see?
52|16|Go now and burn in it. It is all the same whether you bear it patiently or do not bear it with patience. You are only being recompensed for your deeds.”
52|17|Surely the God-fearing shall be in Gardens and bliss,
52|18|enjoying what Allah will have endowed them with; and their Lord will have saved them from the torment of the Blazing Fire.
52|19|(They will be told): “Eat and drink to your hearts' content as a reward for your deeds.”
52|20|The God-fearing shall be reclining on couches facing each other, and We shall wed them to maidens with large, beautiful eyes.
52|21|We shall unite the believers with those descendants of theirs who followed them in their faith, and shall not deny them any part of the reward for their good deeds. Every person is pledged to what he did.
52|22|We shall provide them in abundance with all kinds of fruit and meat, whatever they may desire.
52|23|They shall pass on to one another a cup that will incite neither levity nor sin.
52|24|Youths as fair as hidden pearls will be set apart to wait upon them; they will be running to and fro to serve them.
52|25|They will turn to one another and ask (regarding the past events).
52|26|They will say: “When we were living before among our kinsfolk we lived in constant fear (of Allah's displeasure).
52|27|Then Allah graced us with His favour and saved us from the chastisement of the scorching wind.
52|28|Formerly we had always prayed to Him. Surely He is Most Benign, Most Compassionate.”
52|29|So exhort (them, O Prophet), for by your Lord's Grace, you are neither a soothsayer nor a madman.
52|30|Or do they say: “He is a poet for whom we await an adverse turn of fortune.”
52|31|Tell them: “Wait; I too am waiting with you.”
52|32|Do their minds prompt them to say such things, or are they a people immersed in transgression?”
52|33|Do they say: “He has himself fabricated the Qur'an?” No; the truth is that they are altogether averse to believing.
52|34|(If they are truthful in this), then let them produce a discourse of similar splendour.
52|35|Did they come into being without any creator? Or were they their own creators?
52|36|Or is it they who created the heavens and the earth? No; the truth is that they lack sure faith.
52|37|Or do they have your Lord's treasures in their keeping? Or have absolute authority over them?
52|38|Or do they have a ladder whereon they can climb and attempt to listen (to what is transpiring in the Higher Realm)? Then, let any of them who has listened to it produce a clear proof of it.
52|39|Or does Allah have daughters whereas you have sons?
52|40|Or is it that you ask of them any recompense so that they should fear to be weighed down under the burden of debt?
52|41|Or is it that they have access to (the Truths in) the realm beyond sense-perception which they are writing down?
52|42|Or are they contriving a stratagem against you? If so, that stratagem will rebound against the unbelievers.
52|43|Do they have any god other than Allah? Exalted be Allah above whatever they associate (with Him in His Divinity).
52|44|(So obstinate are they that) even if they were to see some fragments of the sky falling down they would still say: “It is only a mass of cloud.”
52|45|So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs when they shall be struck down,
52|46|when their stratagem shall be of no avail to them, nor shall they be succoured.
52|47|Surely a chastisement awaits the wrong-doers even before the coming of that Day; but most of them do not know.
52|48|Be patient, then, (O Prophet), until the judgement of your Lord comes. For surely you are before Our eyes. And celebrate the praise of your Lord when you rise,
52|49|and also celebrate His praise at night, and at the retreat of the stars.
53|1|By the star when it sets:
53|2|your companion has neither strayed nor is he deluded;
53|3|nor does he speak out of his desire.
53|4|This is nothing but a revelation that is conveyed to him,
53|5|something that a very powerful one has imparted to him,
53|6|one endowed with immense wisdom. He came forth and stood poised,
53|7|being on the higher horizon.
53|8|Then he drew near and hung above suspended,
53|9|until he was two bows' length away, or nearer.
53|10|Then he revealed to Allah's servant whatever he had to reveal.
53|11|His heart added no untruth to what he saw.
53|12|Are you, then, going to contend with him regarding what he sees with his eyes?
53|13|Indeed he saw him a second time,
53|14|by the lote-tree at the farthest boundary,
53|15|near which is the Garden of Abode.
53|16|(This was) when the lote-tree was covered with that which covered it.
53|17|His eye did not waver, nor did it stray,
53|18|and he certainly saw some of the greatest Signs of His Lord.
53|19|Have you ever thought about al-Lat and al-Uzza,
53|20|and about the third deity, al-Manat?
53|21|Shall you have the male issues, and He the female issues?
53|22|That is indeed an unfair division!
53|23|These are nothing but names that you and your forefathers have invented, for which Allah has sent down no authority. They are merely following their conjectures and their carnal desires although guidance has come to them from their Lord.
53|24|Does man imagine that whatever he wishes for is right for him?
53|25|To Allah belong both the Next World and the present.
53|26|Numerous are the angels in the heavens; yet their intercession shall be of no avail, except in regard to those whom He grants the leave of intercession and whose plea He is pleased to accept.
53|27|Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give angels the names of females,
53|28|although they have no knowledge regarding that. They only follow their conjecture and conjecture can never take the place of the Truth.
53|29|So leave alone those who turn away from the remembrance of Us and who seek nothing but the life of the world –
53|30|that being the utmost of their knowledge. Surely your Lord fully knows those who have strayed away from His Path and He also fully knows those who are rightly guided.
53|31|To Allah alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He will requite the evil-doers for their deeds and bestow a goodly reward on those who have done good,
53|32|on those who avoid grave sins and shameful deeds, even if they may sometimes stumble into lesser offences. Surely your Lord is abounding in His Forgiveness. Very well is He aware of you since He produced you from the earth, and while you were still in your mothers' wombs and not yet born. So do not boastfully claim yourselves to be purified. He fully knows those that are truly Godfearing.
53|33|(O Prophet), did you see him who turned away (from the Path of Allah),
53|34|who gave a little, and then stopped?
53|35|Does he have any knowledge of the world beyond the ken of sense-perception, and therefore, clearly sees (the Truth)?
53|36|Has he not been informed of what is in the Scrolls of Moses,
53|37|and of Abraham, who lived up to the trust?
53|38|“That no bearer of a burden shall bear the burden of another,
53|39|and that man shall have nothing but what he has striven for,
53|40|and that (the result of) his striving shall soon be seen,
53|41|and that he shall then be fully recompensed,
53|42|and that the final end is with your Lord,
53|43|and that He it is Who causes people to laugh and to cry,
53|44|and that He it is Who causes death and grants life,
53|45|and He it is Who created the two kinds, the male and the female,
53|46|from a drop of sperm when it was emitted,
53|47|and that it is for Him to grant the second life,
53|48|that He it is Who bestowed wealth and riches,
53|49|that He is the Lord of Sirius,
53|50|that He it is Who destroyed the ancient 'Ad,
53|51|and Thamud, leaving no trace of them,
53|52|and that He it is Who destroyed the people of Noah before for they were much given to iniquity and transgression.
53|53|And He brought perdition upon the subverted cities
53|54|and caused them to be covered with that which He covered them with.
53|55|So, which of your Lord's bounties will you doubt?”
53|56|This is a warning among the warnings of yore.
53|57|The imminent Hour has drawn near,
53|58|and none but Allah can avert it.
53|59|Will you, then, wonder at this?
53|60|Will you laugh at it rather than weep?
53|61|Will you occupy yourselves simply in merriment?
53|62|Prostrate yourselves before Allah, and serve Him.
54|1|The Hour of Resurrection drew near and the moon split asunder.
54|2|(Regardless of any Signs these people see), they turn away and say: “This is an ongoing sorcery.”
54|3|They also gave the lie to (the splitting asunder of the moon) and only followed their desires. Yet everything is destined to reach an end.
54|4|Surely there came to them narratives (of the ancient nations) that should suffice to deter (them from transgression),
54|5|narratives that are full of consummate wisdom. But warnings do not avail them.
54|6|So turn away from them, (O Prophet). On the Day when a caller shall call them to a thing most terrible,
54|7|with down-cast eyes they shall go forth from their graves, as though they were scattered locusts.
54|8|They shall be hurrying forth towards the caller, and the unbelievers (who had once denied this Day), will say: “This is a woeful Day.”
54|9|Before them Noah's people also gave the lie (to his Message). They rejected Our servant as a liar, saying: “He is a madman”; and he was rebuffed.
54|10|Then he called upon His Lord: “Verily I am vanquished; so come You to my aid.”
54|11|Thereupon We opened the gates of the sky for water to pour down,
54|12|and We made the earth burst forth with springs, and all this water converged to fulfil that which had been decreed.
54|13|And We bore Noah on the vessel built of planks and nails,
54|14|which sailed on under Our supervision: a reward for him who had been shown ingratitude.
54|15|And We left the Ark as a Sign. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|16|So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|17|We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|18|'Ad also gave the lie (to Hud). So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|19|We sent a tumultuous wind against them on a day of unremitting misfortune,
54|20|which tore people away and hurled them as though they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.
54|21|So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|22|We have made the Qur'an easy to derive lessons from. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|23|Thamud gave the lie to the warnings,
54|24|saying: “Are we to follow a single mortal, one from among ourselves? If we do that, we shall surely be in error and folly.
54|25|Was there none but he to whom the Reminder could be vouchsafed excluding all others? Nay; he is an insolent liar.”
54|26|(We told Our Messenger): “Tomorrow they shall know who is the insolent liar.
54|27|We shall send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch their end with patience.
54|28|Let them know that the water should be divided between them and the she-camel, each availing their turn.”
54|29|Eventually, they summoned their companion, and he undertook the (outrageous) task and hamstrung the she-camel.
54|30|So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|31|Behold, We sent a single Blast against them, and they became like the trampled twigs of a sheep pen-builder.
54|32|Surely We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|33|Lot's people also gave the lie to the warnings,
54|34|and behold, We let loose upon them a tempest which rained stones upon them, except upon Lot's household whom We rescued in the last hours of the night
54|35|as a favour from Us. Thus do We reward those who give thanks.
54|36|Surely Lot warned his people that We shall seize them (with Our chastisement), but they doubted the warnings.
54|37|Then they even solicited his guests from him, whereupon We blotted out their eyes, (telling them): “Now have a taste of My chastisement and My warnings.”
54|38|Indeed an abiding chastisement came upon them in the morning.
54|39|So have a taste of My chastisement and My warnings.
54|40|Surely We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|41|Warnings also came to the Pharaonites,
54|42|but they gave the lie to Our Signs, to all of them. Thereupon We seized them with the seizing of the Most Mighty, the Most Powerful.
54|43|Are your unbelievers (of Makkah) any better than they? Or have you been granted any immunity in the Scriptures?
54|44|Or do they say: “We are a strong legion, strong enough for victory?”
54|45|Soon shall this legion be routed and shall turn their backs and flee.
54|46|Nay; the Hour of Doom is their appointed time, and the Hour shall be more calamitous and bitter.
54|47|The evil-doers are victims of error and madness.
54|48|There shall come a Day when they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire and will be told: “Now taste the flame of Hell.”
54|49|We have created everything in a determined measure.
54|50|Our command consists of only one Word which is carried out in the twinkling of an eye.
54|51|We did indeed destroy many like you. Is there, then, any who will heed?
54|52|All their deeds are recorded in the Scrolls;
54|53|everything large or small, is duly inscribed.
54|54|Surely those who shun disobedience will dwell amidst Gardens and running streams
54|55|where they will be honourably seated in the presence of a King, Mighty in Power.
55|1|The Merciful One
55|2|has taught the Qur'an,
55|3|has created man,
55|4|and has taught him articulate speech.
55|5|The sun and the moon follow a reckoning,
55|6|and the stars and the trees all prostrate themselves,
55|7|and He has raised up the heaven and has set a balance
55|8|that you may not transgress in the balance,
55|9|but weigh things equitably and skimp not in the balance.
55|10|And He has set up the earth for all beings.
55|11|Therein are fruit and palm-trees with their dates in sheaths,
55|12|and a variety of corn with both husk and grain.
55|13|Which of the bounties of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|14|He has created man from dry, rotten clay like the potter's,
55|15|and has created the jinn from the flame of fire.
55|16|Which of the wonders of your Lord's power will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|17|Lord of the two easts and of the two wests is He.
55|18|Which of the powers of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|19|He unleashed the two seas so that they merge together,
55|20|and yet there is a barrier between them which they may not overstep.
55|21|Which of the wonders of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|22|From these seas come forth pearls and coral.
55|23|Which of the wonders of your Lord's power will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|24|His are the ships, towering on the sea like mountains.
55|25|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|26|All that is on earth will perish,
55|27|only the Person of your Lord, full of majesty and splendour, will endure.
55|28|So which of the wonders of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|29|All in the heavens and the earth entreat Him for their needs; a new, mighty task engages Him each day.
55|30|Which of your Lord's laudable attributes will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|31|O you twain, who are a burden (on the earth), We shall attend to you and call you to account.
55|32|(We shall then see), which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|33|O company of jinn and men, if you have the power to go beyond the bounds of the heavens and the earth, go beyond them! Yet you will be unable to go beyond them for that requires infinite power.
55|34|Which of your Lord's powers will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|35|(If you so venture) a flame of fire and smoke shall be lashed at you, which you shall be unable to withstand.
55|36|Which of your Lord's powers will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|37|(What will happen) when the heaven will be split asunder and will become crimson like leather?
55|38|Which of your Lord's powers will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|39|On that Day there will be no need to ask either men or jinn about their sins.
55|40|(We shall see) which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|41|The culprits shall be known by their marks, and shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet.
55|42|Which of the powers of your Lord, will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|43|(It will be said): “This is the Hell that the culprits had cried lies to.
55|44|They will keep circling around between Hell and boiling water.
55|45|Which of your Lord's powers will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|46|For any who fears to stand before his Lord are two Gardens.
55|47|Which of your Lord's favours will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|48|These Gardens will abound in green, blooming branches.
55|49|Which of your Lord's favours will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|50|In each of the two Gardens are two flowing springs.
55|51|Which of your Lord's favours will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|52|In both these is a pair of every fruit.
55|53|Which of your Lord's favours will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|54|They shall recline on couches lined with brocade, and within reach shall hang the fruits of the two Gardens.
55|55|Which of your Lord's favours will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|56|In the midst of these shall be maidens with modest, restrained glances; maidens whom no man or jinn has ever touched before.
55|57|Which of your Lord's favours will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|58|Lovely as rubies and pearls.
55|59|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|60|Can the reward of goodness be any other than goodness?
55|61|Which of the laudable attributes of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|62|And besides these two there shall be two other Gardens.
55|63|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|64|Two Gardens, dark green and fresh.
55|65|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|66|In them will be two gushing springs.
55|67|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|68|Therein will be fruits and dates and pomegranates.
55|69|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|70|In the midst of these will be maidens, good and comely.
55|71|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|72|There shall be maidens sheltered in tents.
55|73|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|74|No man or jinn ever touched them before.
55|75|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|76|They shall be reclining on green cushions and splendid carpets.
55|77|Which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|78|Blessed be the name of your Lord, the Lord of Majesty and Glory.
56|1|When the Event will come to pass
56|2|– and then there will be no one to deny its occurrence –
56|3|(a calamitous Event) that shall turn things upside down:
56|4|when the earth will suddenly shake with a terrible shaking,
56|5|and the mountains will crumble
56|6|and will scatter abroad into fine dust.
56|7|You shall then become three groups.
56|8|The People on the Right: and how fortunate will be the People on the Right!
56|9|And the People on the Left: and how miserable will be the People on the Left!
56|10|As for the Foremost, they will be the foremost!
56|11|They shall be near-stationed (to their Lord),
56|12|in the Gardens of Bliss.
56|13|A throng of the ancients,
56|14|and a few from later times.
56|15|They (will be seated) on gold-encrusted couches,
56|16|reclining on them, arrayed face to face;
56|17|immortal youths shall go about them
56|18|with goblets and ewers and a cup filled with a drink drawn from a running spring,
56|19|a drink by which their minds will not be clouded nor will it cause drunkenness;
56|20|they will also go about them with the fruits of which they may choose,
56|21|and with the flesh of any fowl that they may desire to eat;
56|22|and there shall be wide-eyed maidens,
56|23|beautiful as pearls hidden in their shells.
56|24|All this shall be theirs as a reward for their deeds.
56|25|There they shall hear no idle talk nor any sinful speech.
56|26|All talk will be sound and upright.
56|27|As for the People on the Right, how fortunate shall be the people on the Right!
56|28|They shall be in the midst of thornless lote trees,
56|29|and flower-clad acacias,
56|30|and extended shade,
56|31|and gushing water,
56|32|and abundant fruit,
56|33|never-ending and unforbidden.
56|34|They shall be on upraised couches,
56|35|and their spouses We shall have brought them into being afresh,
56|36|and shall have made them virgins,
56|37|intensely loving and of matching age.
56|38|All this will be for the People on the Right;
56|39|a large throng from the ancients,
56|40|and also a large throng from those of later times.
56|41|As for the People on the Left: how miserable will be the People on the Left!
56|42|They will be in the midst of scorching wind and boiling water,
56|43|and a shade of thick, pitch-black smoke,
56|44|which will neither be cool nor soothing.
56|45|Surely they had lived before in luxury,
56|46|and had persisted in the Great Sin.
56|47|They used to say: “What! Once we are dead and are reduced to dust and bones, shall we still be raised to a new life from the dead?
56|48|(We) and our fore-fathers of yore?”
56|49|Tell them, (O Prophet): “The earlier ones and the later ones
56|50|shall all be brought together on an appointed Day.
56|51|Then you, the erring ones and those that gave the lie to the Truth,
56|52|shall all eat from the Tree of al-Zaqqum,
56|53|filling your bellies with it;
56|54|and thereupon you shall drink boiling water,
56|55|drinking it as thirsty camels do.”
56|56|Thus shall they be entertained on the Day of Recompense.
56|57|We have created you, then why would you not confirm it?
56|58|Did you ever consider the sperm that you emit?
56|59|Do you create a child out of it, or are We its creators?
56|60|It is We Who ordained death upon you and We are not to be frustrated.
56|61|Had We so wished, nothing could have hindered Us from replacing you by others like yourselves, or transforming you into beings you know nothing about.
56|62|You are well aware of the first creation; then, do you learn no lesson from it?
56|63|Have you considered the seeds you till?
56|64|Is it you or We Who make them grow?
56|65|If We so wished, We could have reduced your harvest to rubble, and you would have been left wonder-struck to exclaim:
56|66|“We have been penalised;
56|67|nay; we have been undone!”
56|68|Did you cast a good look at the water that you drink?
56|69|Is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it We Who brought it down?
56|70|If We had so pleased, We could have made it bitter. So why would you not give thanks?
56|71|Did you consider the fire which you kindle?
56|72|Did you make its tree grow or was it We Who made it grow?
56|73|We made it a reminder and a provision for the needy.
56|74|Glorify, then, (O Prophet), the name of your Great Lord.
56|75|No! I swear by the positions of the stars –
56|76|and this is indeed a mighty oath, if only you knew –
56|77|that this indeed is a noble Qur'an,
56|78|inscribed in a well-guarded Book,
56|79|which none but the pure may touch;
56|80|a revelation from the Lord of the Universe.
56|81|Do you, then, take this discourse in light esteem,
56|82|and your portion in it is simply that you denounce it as false?
56|83|Why, then, when the soul leaps up to the throat,
56|84|the while you are helplessly watching that he is on the verge of death,
56|85|– at that moment when We are closer to him than you, although you do not see (Us)
56|86|if you are not subject to anyone's authority,
56|87|why are you then not able to bring them back to life if you are truthful?
56|88|So if he is one of those who are near-stationed (to Allah),
56|89|then happiness and delight and Gardens of Bliss are his.
56|90|And if he is one of the People on the Right,
56|91|he will be welcomed by the words: “Peace to you” from the People on the Right.
56|92|And if he is one of those who give the lie (to this Message) and go astray,
56|93|then he will be served boiling water,
56|94|and will be scorched by the Fire.
56|95|That indeed is the absolute truth.
56|96|So glorify the name of your Great Lord.
57|1|All that is in the heavens and the earth extols the glory of Allah. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
57|2|His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He has power over everything.
57|3|He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He has knowledge of everything.
57|4|He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself on the Throne. He knows all that enters the earth and all that comes forth from it, and all that comes down from the heaven and all that goes up to it. He is with you wherever you are. Allah sees all that you do.
57|5|His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Him are all matters referred (for judgement).
57|6|He causes the night to pass into the day, and causes the day to pass into the night, and He fully knows all that is hidden in the breasts of people.
57|7|Believe in Allah and in His Messenger and expend of what He has entrusted to you. A great reward awaits those of you who believe and spend their wealth.
57|8|How is it that you do not believe in Allah when the Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord and although he has taken a covenant from you, if indeed you are believers?
57|9|He it is Who sends down Clear Signs to His servant so as to bring you out from darkness into light. Surely Allah is Most Kind and Most Compassionate to you.
57|10|How is it that you do not expend in the Way of Allah when to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? Those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting before the Victory cannot be equated (with those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting afterwards). They are higher in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to each Allah has promised a good reward. Allah is well aware of all that you do.
57|11|Who is it that will give Allah a beautiful loan? A loan that Allah will repay after increasing it many times and grant him a generous reward.
57|12|On that Day you will see believing men and women that their light will be running before them and on their right hands. (They will be told): “A good tiding to you today.” There shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow; therein they shall abide. That indeed is the great triumph.
57|13|On that Day the hypocrites, both men and women, shall say to the believers: “Look at us that we may extract some light from your light.” They will be told: “Go back and seek light for yourselves elsewhere.” Then a wall shall be erected between them with a door in it. On the inside of it there will be mercy, and on the outside of it there will be chastisement.
57|14|The hypocrites will call out to the believers: “Were we not with you?” The believers will reply: “Yes; but you allowed yourselves to succumb to temptations, and you wavered and you remained in doubt and false expectations deluded you until Allah's command came to pass, and the Deluder deluded you concerning Allah.
57|15|So no ransom shall be accepted from you today, nor from those who disbelieved. You are destined for the Fire. That will be your guardian. And that indeed is a grievous destination.
57|16|Is the time not come that the hearts of the believers should be humbled to Allah's remembrance and to the Truth that He has revealed, and that they should not be like those who were vouchsafed the Book and then a long time elapsed so that their hearts were hardened? A great many of them are now evil-doers.
57|17|Know well that Allah revives the earth after it becomes lifeless. We have clearly shown Our Signs to you, perchance you will use your reason.
57|18|Verily those who give alms -- be they men or women, -- and give Allah a beautiful loan shall be repaid after increasing it many times; and theirs shall be a generous reward.
57|19|In Allah's sight only those who truly believe in Allah and His Messengers are utterly truthful and true bearers of witness (for the sake of Allah). For them is their reward and their light. As for those who gave the lie to Our Signs, they are the people of Hell.
57|20|Know well that the life of this world is merely sport and diversion and adornment and an object of your boasting with one another, and a rivalry in the multiplication of riches and children. Its likeness is that of rain: when it produces vegetation it delights the tillers. But then it withers and you see it turn yellow, and then it crumbles away. In the Hereafter there is (either) grievous chastisement (or) forgiveness from Allah and (His) good pleasure. The life of this world is nothing but delusion.
57|21|So vie with one another in seeking to attain your Lord's forgiveness and a Garden whose width is as the width of the heaven and the earth, one which has been prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. That is Allah's bounty which He bestows upon those whom He pleases. Allah is the Lord of abounding bounty.
57|22|No misfortune ever befalls on earth, nor on yourselves but We have inscribed it in the Book before We make it manifest. Surely that is easy for Allah.
57|23|(We do so) that you may not grieve over the loss you suffer, nor exult over what He gave you. Allah does not love the vainglorious, the boastful,
57|24|those who are niggardly and bid others to be niggardly. And he who turns away, (should know that) Allah is Self-Sufficient, Immensely Praiseworthy.
57|25|Indeed We sent Our Messengers with Clear Signs, and sent down with them the Book and the Balance that people may uphold justice. And We sent down iron, wherein there is awesome power and many benefits for people, so that Allah may know who, without even having seen Him, helps Him and His Messengers. Surely Allah is Most Strong, Most Mighty.
57|26|Indeed We sent forth Noah and Abraham and established in their line Prophecy and the Book. Then some of them embraced the guidance and many of them are wicked.
57|27|In their wake, We sent a succession of Our Messengers, and raised Jesus, son of Mary, after all of them, and bestowed upon him the Evangel, and We set tenderness and mercy in the hearts of those that followed him. As for monasticism, it is they who invented it; We did not prescribe it for them. They themselves invented it in pursuit of Allah's good pleasure, and then they did not observe it as it ought to have been observed. So We gave their reward to those of them that believed. But many of them are wicked.
57|28|Believers, have fear of Allah and believe in His Messenger, and He will grant you a two-fold portion of His Mercy, and will appoint for you a light whereby you shall walk; and He will forgive you. Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
57|29|(You should do this) so that the People of the Book know that they have no control over Allah's Bounty, and that all bounty is in Allah's Hand; He bestows it on whomsoever He pleases. Allah is the Lord of abounding bounty.
58|1|Allah has surely heard the words of her who contends with you concerning her husband and complains to Allah. Allah hears what both of you say. Verily Allah is All- Hearing, All-Seeing.
58|2|Those among you who divorce their wives by declaring them to be their mothers, such are not their mothers; none are their mothers except those who gave birth to them. Indeed what they say is highly contemptible and false. Verily Allah is Most Pardoning, Most Forgiving.
58|3|Those who declare their wives to be their mothers and thereafter go back on what they have said shall free a slave before they may touch each other. That is what you are exhorted to do. Allah is fully aware of all your deeds.
58|4|And he who does not find a slave (to free), shall fast for two months consecutively before they may touch each other; and he who is unable to do so shall feed sixty needy people. All this is in order that you may truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. These are the bounds set by Allah; and a grievous chastisement awaits the unbelievers.
58|5|Verily those who oppose Allah and His Messenger shall be brought low even as those before them were brought low. Surely We have sent down Clear Signs; and a humiliating chastisement awaits the unbelievers;
58|6|a chastisement that shall come upon them on the Day when Allah will raise them all to a new life and will inform them of their deeds. Allah has recorded it all while they have forgotten it. Allah is a witness over everything.
58|7|Are you not aware that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth? Never is there any whispering among three but He is their fourth; nor among five but He is their sixth; nor fewer nor more but He is with them wherever they may be. And then He will tell them on the Day of Judgement all that they have done. Surely Allah knows everything.
58|8|Have you not seen those who were forbidden to whisper and yet they engaged in what they had been forbidden? They secretly converse among themselves concerning sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you in a manner that Allah does not greet you, and say to themselves: “Why does Allah not chastise us for these utterances of ours?” Hell it is that shall suffice them, and in it will they burn. How woeful is their destination!
58|9|Believers, when you converse in secrecy, let that not be concerning sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger; rather, converse concerning virtue and piety. And fear Allah to Whom all of you shall be mustered.
58|10|Whispering is an act of Satan, one that aims at causing grief to the believers; yet without Allah's leave no harm can be caused to them. So in Allah should the believers put all their trust.
58|11|Believers, when you are told: “Make room for one another in your assemblies,” then make room; Allah will bestow amplitude on you. And when it is said: “Rise up,” then rise up; Allah will raise to high ranks those of you who believe and are endowed with knowledge. Allah is well aware of all that you do.
58|12|Believers, when you come to the Messenger for private consultation, offer some charity before your consultation with him. That is better for you and more conducive to purity. But if you find nothing to offer in charity, then know that Allah is Most Merciful, Most Compassionate.
58|13|Are you afraid that you will have to offer charity when you hold private conversation with the Prophet? But if you are unable to do so and Allah pardons you, then establish Prayer and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is well aware of all that you do.
58|14|Do you not see those who took for friends a people whom Allah is wroth with? They neither belong to you nor you to them. They swear to a falsehood, and they do so knowingly.
58|15|Allah has prepared for them a grievous chastisement. Indeed, evil are the acts in which they are engaged.
58|16|They have taken their oaths as a shield by means of which they hinder people from the Way of Allah. Theirs shall be a humiliating chastisement.
58|17|Neither their possessions nor their offspring will be of any avail to them against Allah. They are the people of the Fire; therein they shall abide.
58|18|On the Day when Allah will raise them all from the dead they will swear before Him as they swear before you today, thinking that this will avail them. Behold, they are utter liars.
58|19|Satan has gained mastery over them and has made them neglect remembering Allah. They are the party of Satan. Behold, the party of Satan will be the losers.
58|20|Verily those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be among the most abject beings.
58|21|Allah has written: “Surely I will prevail; I and My Messengers.” Verily Allah is Most Strong, Most Mighty.
58|22|You shall not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger even though they be their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. He has inscribed faith in their hearts and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him, and He shall make them enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Therein they shall abide. Allah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. They belong to Allah's party. Verily Allah's party shall prosper.
59|1|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols Allah's Glory: He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
59|2|He it is Who in the first assault drove forth the People of the Book that disbelieved from their homes at the first gathering of forces. You did not believe that they would leave; while they too thought that their fortresses would defend them against Allah. Then Allah came upon them from whence they did not even imagine, casting such terror into their hearts that they destroyed their homes by their own hands and their destruction was also caused by the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson from this, O you who have perceptive eyes!
59|3|If Allah had not decreed banishment for them, He would certainly have chastised them in this world. As for the Hereafter, the chastisement of the Fire awaits them.
59|4|That is because they set themselves against Allah and His Messenger; and whoever sets himself against Allah should know that Allah is surely Most Stern in retribution.
59|5|The palm-trees that you cut down or those that you left standing on their roots, it was by Allah's leave that you did so. (Allah granted you this leave) in order that He might humiliate the evil-doers.
59|6|Whatever Allah has taken away from them and bestowed (as spoils) on His Messenger for which you spurred neither horses nor camels; but Allah grants authority to His Messengers over whomsoever He pleases. Allah has power over everything.
59|7|Whatever (from the possessions of the towns people) Allah has bestowed on His Messenger belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to his kinsfolk, and to the orphans, and to the needy, and to the wayfarer so that it may not merely circulate between the rich among you. So accept whatever the Messenger gives you, and refrain from whatever he forbids you. And fear Allah: verily Allah is Most Stern in retribution.
59|8|It also belongs to the poor Emigrants who have been driven out of their homes and their possessions, those who seek Allah's favour and good pleasure and help Allah and His Messenger. Such are the truthful ones.
59|9|It also belongs to those who were already settled in this abode (of Hijrah) having come to faith before the (arrival of the) Muhajirun (Emigrants). They love those who have migrated to them and do not covet what has been given them; they even prefer them above themselves though poverty be their own lot. And whosoever are preserved from their own greed, such are the ones that will prosper.
59|10|(And it also belongs to) those who came after them, and who pray: “Lord, forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and do not put in our hearts any rancour towards those who believe. Lord, You are the Most Tender, the Most Compassionate.”
59|11|Did you not see the hypocrites say to their brethren, the unbelievers among the People of the Book: “If you are banished we too will go with you and will not listen to anyone concerning you; and if war is waged against you, we will come to your aid.” But Allah bears witness that they are liars.
59|12|To be sure, if they are banished, they will not go with them and if war is waged against them, they will not aid them; and even if they provide any aid to them, they will still turn their backs, and thereafter no aid will be forthcoming to them.
59|13|Surely they have greater dread for you in their hearts than for Allah. That is because they are a people who are devoid of understanding.
59|14|They will never fight against you as a body (in an open battlefield); and if they fight against you they will fight only in fortified townships or from behind walls. Intense is their hostility to one another. You reckon them united while their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people devoid of reason.
59|15|They are like those who tasted the evil consequences of their deeds a short while before. A grievous chastisement awaits them.
59|16|Their parable is that of Satan when he says to man: “Disbelieve,” but when he disbelieves, he says: “I am quit of you. Verily I fear Allah, the Lord of the Universe.”
59|17|In the end both will be in the Fire, and will abide in it. That is the recompense of the wrong-doers.
59|18|Believers, fear Allah and let every person look to what he sends forward for the morrow. Fear Allah; Allah is well aware of all that you do.
59|19|And be not like those who forgot Allah and so He made them oblivious of themselves. They are the wicked ones.
59|20|Those destined for the Fire and those destined for Paradise cannot be alike. Verily it is those destined for Paradise who shall triumph.
59|21|Had We sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain you would indeed have seen it humbling itself and breaking asunder out of fear of Allah. We propound such parables to people that they may reflect.
59|22|He is Allah: there is no god but He; the Knower of the unseen and the manifest, He is the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.
59|23|He is Allah: there is no god but He: the King, the Holy, the All-Peace, the Giver of security, the Overseer, the Most Mighty, the Overpowering, the All-Great. Exalted be He from whatever they associate with Him.
59|24|He is Allah, the Planner, Executer and Fashioner of creation. His are the names most beautiful. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth extols His Glory. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
60|1|Believers, if you have left (your homes and) have come forth to struggle in My Way and to seek My good pleasure, do not make friends with My enemies and your enemies. You befriend them whereas they have spurned the Truth that has come to you; and (such is their enmity that) they expel the Messenger and yourselves for no other reason than that you believe in Allah, your Lord. You send to them messages of friendship in secrecy, although I know well whatever you do, be it secretly or publicly. And whosoever of you does so has indeed strayed far away from the Straight Path.
60|2|If they could overcome you, they would act as your foes and would hurt you by their hands and tongues, and would love to see you become unbelievers.
60|3|On the Day of Resurrection neither your blood-kindred nor your own offspring will avail you. (On that Day) He will separate you. Allah sees all that you do.
60|4|You have a good example in Abraham and his companions: they said to their people: “We totally dissociate ourselves from you, and from the deities that you worship instead of Allah. We renounce you and there has come to be enmity and hatred between us and you until you believe in Allah, the One True God.” (But you may not emulate) Abraham's saying to his father: “Certainly I will ask pardon for you, although I have no power over Allah to obtain anything on your behalf.” (And Abraham and his companions prayed): “Our Lord, in You have we put our trust, and to You have we turned, and to You is our ultimate return.
60|5|Our Lord, do not make us a test for the unbelievers, and forgive us, our Lord. Surely You are Most Mighty, Most Wise.”
60|6|Indeed there is a good example for you in them; a good example for anyone who looks forward to Allah and the Last Day. As for him who turns away, Allah is All-Sufficient, Immensely Praiseworthy.
60|7|It may well be that Allah will implant love between you and those with whom you have had enmity. Allah is Most Powerful; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
60|8|Allah does not forbid that you be kind and just to those who did not fight against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves those who are equitable.
60|9|Allah only forbids you to be friends with those who have fought against you on account of religion and who have driven you out of your homes and have abetted in your expulsion. And any who make friends with them, they are the wrong-doers.
60|10|Believers, when believing women come to you as Emigrants (in the cause of faith), examine them. Allah fully knows (the truth) concerning their faith. And when you have ascertained them to be believing women, do not send them back to the unbelievers. Those women are no longer lawful to the unbelievers, nor are those unbelievers lawful to those (believing) women. Give their unbelieving husbands whatever they have spent (as bridal-dues); and there is no offence for you to marry those women if you give them their bridal-dues. Do not hold on to your marriages with unbelieving women: ask for the return of the bridal-due you gave to your unbelieving wives and the unbelievers may ask for the return of the bridal-due they had given to their believing wives. Such is Allah's command. He judges between you. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
60|11|And if you fail to receive from the unbelievers a part of the bridal-due of your disbelieving wives, and then your turn comes, pay to those who have been left on the other side an amount the like of the bridal-due that they have paid. And have fear of Allah in Whom you believe.
60|12|O Prophet, when believing women come to you and pledge to you that they will not associate aught with Allah in His Divinity, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illicit sexual intercourse, that they will not kill their children, that they will not bring forth a calumny between their hands and feet, and that they will not disobey you in anything known to be good, then accept their allegiance and ask Allah to forgive them. Surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
60|13|Believers, do not make friends with those against whom Allah is wrathful and who are despaired of the Hereafter, as despaired as are the unbelievers lying in their graves.
61|1|All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth extols Allah's glory. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
61|2|Believers, why do you profess that which you do not practise?
61|3|It is most loathsome in the sight of Allah that you should profess what you do not practise.
61|4|Allah indeed loves those who fight in His Way as though they are a solid wall cemented with molten lead.
61|5|And call to mind when Moses said to his people: “O my people, why do you torment me when you know well that I am Allah's Messenger to you?” So when they deviated, Allah made their hearts deviant. Allah does not direct the evil-doers to the Right Way.
61|6|And call to mind when Jesus, son of Mary, said: “O Children of Israel, I am Allah's Messenger to you, I verify the Torah which has come before me, and I give you the glad tiding of a Messenger who shall come after me, his name being Ahmad.” Yet when he came to them with Clear Signs they said: “This is sheer trickery.”
61|7|Who would be more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah the while he is being called to Islam? Allah does not direct such evildoing folk to the Right Way.
61|8|They seek to extinguish Allah's light (by blowing) with their mouths, but Allah shall spread His light in all its fullness, howsoever the unbelievers may abhor this.
61|9|He it is Who has sent forth the Messenger with the Guidance and the True Religion that He may make it prevail over all religion, however those that associate aught with Allah in His Divinity might dislike this.
61|10|Believers, shall I direct you to a commerce that will deliver you from a grievous chastisement?
61|11|Have faith in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the Way of Allah with your possessions and your lives. That is better for you if you only knew.
61|12|He will forgive you your sins and will admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. He will lodge you in excellent mansions in the Gardens of eternity. That is the supreme triumph.
61|13|He will also grant you the other favour that you desire: help from Allah and a victory that will come soon. Give glad tidings of this to the believers.
61|14|Believers, become Allah's helpers, as Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples: “Who is my helper in (calling people) to Allah?” The disciples had responded by saying: “We are Allah's helpers.” Then a section of the Children of Israel believed and a section rejected the call. Thereafter We aided the believers against their enemies, and they prevailed.
62|1|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols the glory of Allah, the Sovereign, the Holy, the All- Mighty, the All-Wise.
62|2|He it is Who has sent to the gentiles a Messenger from among themselves, one who rehearses to them His verses, purifies their lives, and imparts to them the Book and the Wisdom although before that they were in utter error;
62|3|and (He has also) sent him to those others who have not yet joined them. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
62|4|Such is Allah's favour: He bestows it on whomsoever He pleases. Allah is the Lord of abounding favour.
62|5|The parable of those who were charged with the Torah and then they failed to live up to it is that of a donkey laden with books. Even more evil is the parable of the people who gave the lie to the Signs of Allah. Allah does not direct such wrong-doers to the Right Way.
62|6|Tell them: “O you who have become Judaised, if you arrogantly fancy that you are Allah's favourites to the exclusion of all people, then wish for death, if you are truthful in your claim.”
62|7|But they shall never wish for death because of the (evil) deeds they have committed. Allah is well aware of these evil-doers.
62|8|Tell them: “The death from which you flee will certainly overtake you. Then you will be returned to Him Who fully knows what is hidden and what is manifest. Thereupon He will let you know all that you used to do.”
62|9|Believers, when the call for Prayer is made on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and give up all trading. That is better for you, if you only knew.
62|10|But when the Prayer is ended, disperse in the land and seek Allah's Bounty, and remember Allah much so that you may prosper.
62|11|Yet no sooner than they saw some trading or amusement, they flocked to it and left you standing by yourself. Tell them: “That which is with Allah is far better than amusement and trading. Allah is the Best Provider of sustenance.”
63|1|(O Prophet), when the hypocrites come to you, they say: “We bear witness that you are certainly Allah's Messenger.” Allah certainly knows that you are His Messenger. But Allah also bears witness that the hypocrites are utter liars!
63|2|They shelter behind their oath, and thus hinder their own selves and others from the Path of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do.
63|3|All that is because they first believed and then disbelieved, and therefore a seal was set on their hearts; as a result they understand nothing.
63|4|When you look at them, their persons are pleasing, and when they speak, you pay heed to what they say. But in truth they are (merely) beams of timber propped-up (against a wall). They consider every shout they hear to be directed against them. They are your utter enemies; guard against them. May Allah do away with them! How are they being turned away (from the Truth)?
63|5|When it is said to them: “Come, Allah's Messenger will seek forgiveness for you,” they (contemptuously) shake their heads and you see them holding back in pride.
63|6|It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or not; for Allah shall never forgive them. Surely Allah does not direct the transgressing folk to the Right Way.
63|7|It is they who say: “Give nothing to those who are with the Messenger of Allah so that they may disperse.” (They say so although) the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah. But the hypocrites do not understand.
63|8|They say: “When we return to Madinah, the honourable ones will drive out from it those that are abject.” In truth, all honour belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger, and to the believers. But the hypocrites do not know.
63|9|Believers, let your possessions and your offspring not make you negligent of Allah's remembrance. For whoso does that, they will be the losers.
63|10|And spend of what Allah has granted you by way of sustenance before death should come to any of you and he should say: “Lord, why did You not defer my return for a while so that I might give alms and be among the righteous?”
63|11|But when a person's term comes to an end, Allah never grants any respite. Allah is well aware of all that you do.
64|1|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols Allah's glory. His is the sovereignty and to Him is all praise due; He has power over everything.
64|2|He it is Who has created you: and among you are those that deny the Truth and among you are those that believe in it. Allah observes all that you do.
64|3|He created the heavens and the earth with Truth and shaped you, giving you excellent shapes. And to Him is your ultimate return.
64|4|He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you disclose. Allah even knows what lies hidden in the breasts of people.
64|5|Has the news of the unbelievers of the past not reached you? (They disbelieved) and then tasted its evil consequence. A grievous chastisement awaits them.
64|6|This was because their Messengers would come to them with Clear Signs, but they would say: “Shall mortals (like ourselves) guide us to the Right Way?” They rejected the Truth and turned away. Thereupon Allah became unconcerned with them, for Allah is Self-Sufficient, Innately Praiseworthy.
64|7|The unbelievers have vehemently contended that they shall not be raised to life. Say to them: “Yes, by my Lord, you shall surely be raised to life, and you shall certainly be fully informed of all that you did. That is easy enough for Allah.”
64|8|So believe in Allah and in His Messenger and in the Light that We have sent down. Allah is fully aware of what you do.
64|9|(You shall come to know that) when He will assemble you on the Day of Gathering. That shall be the Day (to determine) mutual gains and losses. Whoever believes in Allah and acts righteously, Allah will have his evil deeds expunged and will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Therein they shall abide forever. That is the supreme triumph.
64|10|As for those who disbelieved and gave the lie to Our Signs: they shall be the inmates of the Fire, and will abide in it. That is a woeful resort!
64|11|No misfortune ever befalls unless it be by Allah's leave. And whosoever has faith in Allah, Allah directs his heart along the Right Path. Allah has knowledge of everything.
64|12|Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away from obedience, (then know that) Our Messenger has no other duty than to clearly convey the Truth.
64|13|Allah there is no god but He; in Allah should the believers put all their trust.
64|14|Believers, there are enemies to you from among your spouses and your off-spring, so beware of them. But if you forgive and overlook their offences and pardon them, then surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
64|15|Your possessions and your offspring are nothing but a trial for you. And there awaits a great reward for you with Allah.
64|16|So hold Allah in awe as much as you can, and listen and obey, and be charitable. This is for your own good. And whoever remains safe from his own greediness, it is such that will prosper.
64|17|If you give Allah a goodly loan, He will increase it for you several fold and will forgive you. Allah is Most Appreciative, Most Forbearing.
64|18|He knows that which is beyond the ken of perception as well as that which can be perceived. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.
65|1|O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for their waiting-period, and compute the waiting period accurately, and hold Allah, your Lord, in awe. Do not turn them out of their homes (during the waiting period) – nor should they go away (from their homes) – unless they have committed a manifestly evil deed. Such are the bounds set by Allah; and he who transgresses the bounds set by Allah commits a wrong against himself. You do not know: maybe Allah will cause something to happen to pave the way (for reconciliation).
65|2|And when they reach the end of their term (of waiting), then either honourably retain them (in the bond of wedlock) or honourably part with them, and call two persons of known probity as witnesses from among yourselves, and (let these witnesses) give upright testimony for the sake of Allah. That is to what all those that believe in Allah and the Last Day are exhorted. Allah will find a way out for him who fears Allah,
65|3|and will provide him sustenance from whence he never even imagined. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He shall suffice him. Surely Allah brings about what He decrees; Allah has set a measure for everything.
65|4|The waiting period of those of your women who have lost all expectation of menstruation shall be three months in case you entertain any doubt; and the same shall apply to those who have not yet menstruated. As for pregnant women, their waiting period shall be until the delivery of their burden. Allah will create ease for him who fears Allah.
65|5|This is the commandment of Allah that He has revealed to you. Whoever fears Allah, He will expunge his evil deeds and will richly reward him.
65|6|(During the waiting period) lodge them according to your means wherever you dwell, and do not harass them to make them miserable. And if they are pregnant, provide for them maintenance until they have delivered their burden. And if they suckle your offspring whom they bore you, then give them due recompense, and graciously settle the question of compensation between yourselves by mutual understanding. But if you experience difficulty (in determining the compensation for suckling) then let another woman suckle the child.
65|7|Whoever has abundant means, let him spend according to his means; and he whose means are straitened, let him spend out of what Allah has given him. Allah does not burden any human being beyond the means that He has bestowed upon him. Possibly Allah will grant ease after hardship.
65|8|How many towns rebelled against the commandment of their Lord and His Messengers. Then We called them to a stern accounting, and subjected them to a harrowing chastisement.
65|9|So they tasted the evil fruit of their deeds; and the fruit of their deeds was utter loss.
65|10|Allah has laid in store for them a grievous chastisement. So fear Allah, O people of understanding who have attained to faith. Allah has sent down to you an Exhortation,
65|11|a Messenger who rehearses to you Allah's verses that clearly expound the Guidance so that He may bring out those that believe and act righteously, from every kind of darkness into light. He will admit whosoever believes in Allah and acts righteously to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall abide in them forever. For such has Allah made an excellent provision.
65|12|Allah it is He Who created seven heavens, and, like them, the earth. His commandment descends among them. (All this is being stated so that you know) that Allah has power over everything, and that Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge.
66|1|O Prophet, why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful for you? Is it to please your wives? Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
66|2|Allah has prescribed for you a way for the absolution of your oaths. Allah is your Guardian. He is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
66|3|The Prophet confided something to one of his wives and then she disclosed it (to another); so after Allah revealed to the Prophet (that she had disclosed that secret), he made a part of it known to her and passed over a part of it. And when he told her about this (i.e., that she had disclosed the secret entrusted to her), she asked: “Who informed you of this?” He said: “I was told of it by He Who is All-Knowing, All-Aware.”
66|4|If the two of you turn in repentance to Allah (that is better for you), for the hearts of both of you have swerved from the Straight Path. But if you support one another against the Prophet, then surely Allah is his Protector; and after that Gabriel and all righteous believers and the angels are all his supporters.
66|5|Maybe if he were to divorce you, your Lord might grant him in exchange wives better than you – those who truly submit to Allah, are full of faith, obedient, disposed to repentance, and given to worship and fasting – both previously wedded ones and virgins.
66|6|Believers, guard yourselves and your kindred against a Fire whose fuel is human beings and stones, a Fire held in the charge of fierce and stern angels who never disobey what He has commanded them, and always do what they are bidden.
66|7|(It will then be said): “Unbelievers, make no excuses today. You are being recompensed for nothing else but your deeds.”
66|8|Believers, turn to Allah in sincere repentance; maybe your Lord will expunge your evil deeds and admit you to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow. This will be on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who have embraced faith and are with him; their light will be running before them and on their right hands, and they will say: “Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us. Surely You have power over everything.”
66|9|O Prophet, strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe with them. Hell shall be their resort. What a grievous end!
66|10|Allah has set forth for the unbelievers the parable of the wives of Noah and Lot. They were wedded to two of Our righteous servants, but each acted treacherously with her husband, and their husbands could be of no avail to them against Allah. The two of them were told: “Enter the Fire with all the others who enter it.”
66|11|Allah has set forth for the believers the parable of Pharaoh's wife. She prayed: “My Lord, build for me a house with You in Paradise and deliver me from Pharaoh and his misdeeds; and deliver me from the iniquitous people.”
66|12|Allah has also set forth the parable of Mary, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity, and into whom We breathed of Our Spirit, and who testified to the words of her Lord and His Books. She was among the obedient.
67|1|Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of the Universe, and Who has power over everything;
67|2|Who created death and life that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving;
67|3|Who created the seven heavens one upon another. You will see no incongruity in the Merciful One's creation. Turn your vision again, can you see any flaw?
67|4|Then turn your vision again, and then again; in the end your vision will come back to you, worn out and frustrated.
67|5|We have adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and have made them a means to drive away the satans. We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blazing Fire.
67|6|The chastisement of Hell awaits those who disbelieve in their Lord. What a wretched destination!
67|7|When they will be cast into it, they will hear it roar as it boils,
67|8|as though it will burst with rage. Every time a multitude is cast into it, its keepers will ask them: “Did no warner come to you?”
67|9|They will say: “Yes, a warner came to us, but we gave the lie to him and said: 'Allah has revealed nothing. You are surely in huge error.'
67|10|They will say: 'If we had only listened and understood, we would not be among the inmates of the Blazing Fire.'”
67|11|Thus will they confess their sins. Damned are these inmates of the Blazing Fire.
67|12|Surely forgiveness and a mighty reward await those who fear Allah without seeing Him.
67|13|Whether you speak in secrecy or aloud, (it is all the same to Allah). He even knows the secrets that lie hidden in the breasts of people.
67|14|Would He not know, He Who has created, when He is All-Subtle, All-Aware?
67|15|He it is Who made the earth subservient to you. So traverse in its tracks and partake of the sustenance He has provided. To Him will you be resurrected.
67|16|Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to cave in with you, and then suddenly it will begin to rock violently?
67|17|Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not let loose upon you a storm of stones? Then shall you know what My warning is like!
67|18|Those who came before them also gave the lie (to the Messengers): then how awesome was My chastisement!
67|19|Have they not seen birds above them spreading and closing their wings, with none holding them except the Merciful One? He oversees everything.
67|20|Which is your army that will come to your aid against the Merciful Lord? But the unbelievers are in utter delusion.
67|21|Who shall provide for you if He withholds His sustenance? Nay; but they persist in rebellion and aversion.
67|22|Who is better guided: he who walks grovelling on his face, or he who walks upright on a Straight Path?
67|23|Say: “He it is Who has brought you into being, and has given you hearing and sight, and has given you hearts to think and understand. How seldom do you give thanks!”
67|24|Say: “Allah it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you will be mustered.”
67|25|They say: “If you are truthful, tell us when will this promise (of the Hereafter) be fulfilled?”
67|26|Say: “Allah alone knows about that; and I am no more than a plain warner.”
67|27|When they will see it near at hand, the faces of all those who had denied it will be distraught, and then they will be told: “This is the doom which you used to ask for.”
67|28|Say to them: “Did you ever consider: whether Allah destroys me and those that are with me, or shows mercy to us, who can protect the unbelievers from a grievous chastisement?”
67|29|Say to them: “He is Merciful, and it is in Him that we believe, and it is in Him that we put all our trust. Soon will you know who is in manifest error.”
67|30|Say to them: “Did you even consider: if all the water that you have (in the wells) were to sink down into the depths of the earth, who will produce for you clear, flowing water?”
68|1|Nun. By the pen and what the scribes write.
68|2|By your Lord's Grace, you are not afflicted with madness,
68|3|and surely yours shall be a never-ending reward,
68|4|and you are certainly on the most exalted standard of moral excellence.
68|5|So you will soon see, and they too will see,
68|6|which of you is afflicted with madness.
68|7|Surely your Lord knows well those who have strayed from His Way just as He knows well those who are on the Right Way.
68|8|Do not, then, yield to those who reject the Truth, decrying it as false;
68|9|they would wish you to be pliant so that they too may be pliant.
68|10|And do not yield to any contemptible swearer,
68|11|the fault-finder who goes around slandering,
68|12|the hinderer of good, the transgressor, the sinful;
68|13|the coarse-grained, and above all mean and ignoble;
68|14|(who so acts) simply because he has wealth and sons,
68|15|and whenever Our verses are rehearsed to him, he says: “These are fairy- tales of times gone by.”
68|16|Soon shall We brand him on his snout.
68|17|We have put them [i.e., the Makkans] to test even as We put to test the owners of the orchard when they vowed that they would gather the fruit of their orchard in the morning,
68|18|without making any allowance (for the will of Allah).
68|19|Thereupon a calamity from your Lord passed over it while they were asleep,
68|20|and so by morning the orchard lay as though it had been fully harvested.
68|21|At daybreak they called out to one another:
68|22|“Hurry to your orchard if you would gather its fruit.”
68|23|So off they went, whispering to one another:
68|24|“No destitute person shall enter it today.”
68|25|They went forth early, believing that they had the power (to gather the fruit).
68|26|But as soon as they beheld the orchard, (they cried out): “We have certainly lost the way;
68|27|rather, we are utterly ruined.”
68|28|The best among them said: “Did I not say to you: why do you not give glory to (your Lord)?”
68|29|They cried out: “Glory be to our Lord! Certainly we were sinners.”
68|30|Then they began to reproach one another.
68|31|They said: “Woe to us! We had indeed transgressed.
68|32|Maybe our Lord will give us a better orchard in its place; to our Lord do we penitently turn.”
68|33|Such is the chastisement; and the chastisement of the Hereafter is assuredly even greater, if only they knew.
68|34|Surely the God-fearing shall have Gardens of bliss with their Lord.
68|35|What! Shall We treat those who have submitted (to Our command) like those who have acted as criminals?
68|36|What is the matter with you? How ill do you judge!
68|37|Or do you have a Book wherein you read
68|38|that (in the Hereafter) you shall have all that you choose for yourselves?
68|39|Or have We sworn a covenant with you which We are bound to keep till the Day of Resurrection, (a covenant requiring that whatever you ordain for yourselves shall be yours)?
68|40|Ask them: “Which of them can guarantee that?
68|41|Or has something been guaranteed by any of those whom they associate with Allah in His Divinity?” If so, let them bring forth their associates, if they are truthful.
68|42|On the Day when the dreadful calamity will unfold, when people will be summoned to prostrate themselves, and yet they will not be able to prostrate.
68|43|Their eyes shall be downcast and ignominy shall overwhelm them. For when they were safe and sound, they were summoned to prostrate themselves, (and they refused).
68|44|So leave Me, (O Prophet), to deal with him who gives the lie to this Discourse. We shall draw them little by little (to their undoing) in a way that they will not know.
68|45|I am giving them a respite. Great is My scheme!
68|46|Or are you asking them for some compensation so that they feel burdened with debt?
68|47|Or do they have any knowledge of the Unseen which they are now writing down?
68|48|So bear with patience until the Judgement of your Lord comes, and do not belike the man in the fish (i.e., Jonah) who called out, choking with grief:
68|49|had his Lord not bestowed His favour upon him, he would have been cast upon that barren shore (and would have remained there) in disgrace.
68|50|But his Lord exalted him, and included him among His righteous servants.
68|51|When the unbelievers hear this Exhortation, they look at you as though they would knock you off your feet with their (hostile) glances. They say: “Surely he is afflicted with madness”;
68|52|although this is nothing but an Exhortation (to goodness) for everyone in the world.
69|1|The indubitable event!
69|2|And what is that indubitable event?
69|3|And what do you know what that indubitable event is?
69|4|The Thamud and the Ad denied the (possibility of a) sudden calamity, calling it false.
69|5|Then the Thamud were destroyed by an awesome upheaval;
69|6|and the Ad were destroyed by a furiously raging wind-storm
69|7|which He let loose upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession; so that (if you had been there) you might have seen people lying prostrate, as though they were uprooted trunks of hollowed palm trees.
69|8|Do you now see any trace of them?
69|9|Pharaoh and those before him and the people of the overturned habitations all engaged in the same great sin.
69|10|They did not follow the Messenger of their Lord, and so He seized them with a severe grip.
69|11|Verily when the water rose to great heights, We bore you upon a floating vessel (i.e. the Ark)
69|12|so that We might make it an instructive event for you, and retentive ears might preserve its memory.
69|13|So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast
69|14|and the earth and the mountains are carried aloft and are crushed to bits at one stroke,
69|15|on that Day shall that indubitable event come to pass;
69|16|when the sky will be rent asunder, the grip holding it together having loosened on that Day,
69|17|and the angels will stand on the sides, with eight of them bearing aloft the Throne of your Lord on that Day.
69|18|That will be the Day when you shall be brought forth (before Allah) and no secret of yours shall remain hidden.
69|19|On that Day, he whose Record is given to him in his right hand will say: “Lo! Read my Record!
69|20|Verily I was sure that I would be handed over my account.”
69|21|Then he shall find himself in a life of bliss;
69|22|in a lofty Garden
69|23|the clusters of whose fruit will be hanging low to be within reach (of the inmates of Paradise).
69|24|(They will be told): “Eat and drink with good cheer as a reward for the good deeds you did in the days that have passed by.”
69|25|As for him whose Record will be given to him in his left hand, he will exclaim: “Would that I had never been given my Record,
69|26|and had not known my account.
69|27|Oh! Would that the death that came to me in the world had made an end of me!
69|28|My riches have not availed me,
69|29|and my authority has vanished.”
69|30|(A command will be issued): “Seize him and shackle him,
69|31|then cast him in the Fire,
69|32|then fasten him with a chain, seventy cubits long.
69|33|He would not believe in Allah, the Most Great;
69|34|nor would he urge the feeding of the poor.
69|35|Today he has been left here friendless;
69|36|and has no food except the filth from the washing of wounds,
69|37|which only the sinners will eat.”
69|38|But no; I swear by what you see,
69|39|and by what you do not see,
69|40|that this is the speech of an honourable Messenger,
69|41|not the speech of a poet. Little do you believe!
69|42|Nor is this the speech of a soothsayer. Little do you reflect!
69|43|It has been revealed by the Lord of the Universe.
69|44|And if he [i.e., the Prophets] had forged this Discourse and thereafter ascribed it to Us,
69|45|We would surely have seized him by the right hand,
69|46|and then severed his life vein;
69|47|and not one of you would have been able to withhold Us from doing so.
69|48|Surely it is a Good Counsel for the God-fearing.
69|49|We certainly know that some among you will give the lie to it,
69|50|and surely it will be a cause of regret for the unbelievers.
69|51|Certainly it is a Truth of absolute certainty.
69|52|So glorify the name of your Lord Most Great.
70|1|A beseecher besought the visitation of chastisement,
70|2|(a chastisement meant) for the unbelievers, one which none can avert;
70|3|a chastisement from Allah, the Lord of the ascending steps,
70|4|by which the angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in one Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years.
70|5|So, (O Prophet), persevere with gracious perseverance.
70|6|Verily they think that the chastisement is far off,
70|7|while We think that it is near at hand.
70|8|It shall befall on a Day whereon the sky will become like molten brass,
70|9|and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool,
70|10|and no bosom friend will enquire about any of his bosom friends
70|11|although they shall be within sight of one another. The guilty one would fain ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his children,
70|12|and his spouse and his brother,
70|13|and his kinsfolk who had stood by him,
70|14|and all persons of the earth, if only he could thus save himself.
70|15|By no means! It will be the fierce flame
70|16|that will strip off the scalp.
70|17|It shall insistently summon him who turned his back and retreated,
70|18|and amassed wealth and covetously hoarded it.
70|19|Verily man is impatient by nature:
70|20|bewailing when evil befalls him,
70|21|and tight-fisted when good fortune visits him,
70|22|except those that pray,
70|23|and are constant in their Prayer;
70|24|and those in whose wealth there is a known right
70|25|for those that ask and those that are dispossessed,
70|26|those who firmly believe in the Day of Recompense,
70|27|and fear the chastisement of their Lord –
70|28|surely the chastisement of their Lord is a thing none can feel secure from –
70|29|and those who guard their private parts,
70|30|except in regard to their spouses and those whom their right hands possess, for in regard to them they are not reproachable,
70|31|but any who seeks to go beyond that, it is indeed they who are the transgressors,
70|32|and those who fulfil their trusts and their covenants,
70|33|and those who are upright in their testimonies;
70|34|and who take due care of their Prayer:
70|35|all these shall live honourably in the Gardens.
70|36|But what is the matter with the unbelievers who are hurrying towards you
70|37|in crowds, both on the right and on the left?
70|38|Does everyone of them wish to enter the Garden of Bliss?
70|39|By no means! They know that which We have created them from.
70|40|I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We have the power
70|41|to replace them by others who would be better than they; and We shall certainly not be overpowered.
70|42|So leave them to engage in vain talk and to amuse themselves until they come face to face with the Day which they are promised,
70|43|the Day on which they will hastily come forth from their graves, as though they were hurrying on to the altars of their deities.
70|44|Their eyes will be downcast and disgrace will overwhelm them. Such is the Day that they were promised.
71|1|We sent Noah to his people (and directed him): “Warn your people before a grievous chastisement comes upon them.”
71|2|Noah said: “My people, I have certainly been sent as a clear warner to you,
71|3|that you serve Allah and fear Him, and follow me;
71|4|He will forgive your sins and will grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when Allah's appointed term comes, it cannot be deferred; if you only knew!”
71|5|He said: “My Lord, I called my people by night and by day,
71|6|but the more I called, the farther they fled.
71|7|And every time I called them so that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears and wrapped up their faces with their garments and obstinately clung to their attitude, and waxed very proud.
71|8|Then I summoned them openly,
71|9|and preached to them in public, and also addressed them in secret.
71|10|I said to them: “Ask forgiveness from your Lord; surely He is Most Forgiving.
71|11|He will shower upon you torrents from heaven,
71|12|and will provide you with wealth and children, and will bestow upon you gardens and rivers.
71|13|What is amiss with you that you do not look forward to the majesty of Allah
71|14|when He has created you in stages?
71|15|Do you not see how Allah has created seven heavens, one upon the other,
71|16|and has placed the moon in them as a light, and the sun as a radiant lamp?
71|17|And Allah has caused you to grow out of the earth so wondrously,
71|18|and He will later cause you to return to it and will then again bring you out of it.
71|19|Allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you
71|20|so that you may tread its spacious paths.”
71|21|Noah said: “My Lord, they did not pay heed to what I said, and followed those (nobles) whose possession of wealth and children has led them to an even greater loss.
71|22|They contrived a plot of great magnitude.
71|23|They said: “Do not abandon your deities; do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghuth, nor Yauq, nor Nasr.
71|24|They have misled many. So do not enable these evildoers to increase in anything except straying (from the Right Way).”
71|25|And so they were drowned on account of their sins, and then cast into the Fire, and did not find any other than Allah, to come forth to their help.
71|26|Noah said: “My Lord, do not leave out of these unbelievers even a single dweller on earth,
71|27|for certainly if You should leave them (alive), they will mislead Your servants, and will beget none but sinners and utter unbelievers.
71|28|My Lord, forgive me and my parents, and whoever enters my house as a believer, and forgive all believers, both men and women, and do not increase the wrong-doers in anything except perdition.”
72|1|Say, (O Prophet), it was revealed to me that a band of jinn attentively listened to (the recitation of the Qur'an) and then (went back to their people) and said:
72|2|“We have indeed heard a wonderful Qur'an which guides to the Right Way; so we have come to believe in it, and we will not associate aught with Our Lord in His Divinity”;
72|3|and that “He – exalted be His Majesty – has not taken to Himself either a wife or a son”;
72|4|and that “the foolish among us have been wont to say outrageous things about Allah”;
72|5|and that “we had thought that men and jinn would never speak a lie about Allah”,
72|6|and that “some from among the humans used to seek protection of some among the jinn, and thus they increased the arrogance of the jinn”;
72|7|and that “they thought, even as you thought, that Allah would never raise anyone (as a Messenger)”;
72|8|and that “we tried to pry (the secrets of) the heaven, but we found it full of terrible guards and shooting meteors”;
72|9|and that “we would take up stations in the heaven to try to hear but anyone who now attempts to listen finds a shooting meteor in wait for him”;
72|10|and that “we do not know whether evil is intended for those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends to direct them to the Right Way”;
72|11|and that “some of us are upright and some of us are otherwise for we follow widely divergent paths”;
72|12|and that “we thought that we will neither be able to frustrate Allah on earth, nor frustrate Him by flight”;
72|13|and that “when we heard the teaching of the Right Way we came to believe in it; he who believes in His Lord shall have no fear of suffering loss or being subjected to any injustice”;
72|14|and that “among us some are Muslims (Those who have submitted to Allah), and some of us are deviant. So those who became Muslims found the Right Course;
72|15|but those who deviated from the Truth, will be the fuel for Hell.”
72|16|If people were to keep firmly to the Right Way, We would have vouchsafed them abundant rain
72|17|so that We might try them through this bounty. Whoso turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to suffer a grievous chastisement;
72|18|and that “mosques belong to Allah, so do not invoke anyone with Him”;
72|19|and when Allah's servant stood up to call on Him, they well-nigh swarmed him.
72|20|Say, (O Prophet): “I call on my Lord alone, and I do not associate aught with Him in His Divinity.”
72|21|Say: “Surely neither it is in my power to hurt you nor to bring you to the Right Way.”
72|22|Say: “None can protect me from Allah, nor can I find a refuge apart from Him.
72|23|(My task is no more than) to deliver Allah's proclamation and His messages. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, surely the Fire of Hell awaits him; therein he will abide in perpetuity.”
72|24|(They shall not change their ways) until they see that against which they had been warned, and then they will know whose helpers are weaker and whose supporters are fewer in number.
72|25|Say: “I know not whether what you are promised is near or whether my Lord will prolong its term.
72|26|He is the Knower of the Unseen, and He does not disclose His Unseen to anyone
72|27|other than to a Messenger whom He chooses (for the bestowal of any part of the knowledge of the Unseen), whereafter He appoints guards who go before him and behind him,
72|28|so that He may know that they have delivered the messages of their Lord. He encompasses in His knowledge their surroundings and keeps a count of all things.”
73|1|O you the (sleeping) enwrapped one!
73|2|Stand up in Prayer by night, all but a small part of it;
73|3|half of it, or reduce it a little;
73|4|or add to it a little; and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.
73|5|Behold, We shall cast upon you a Weighty Word.
73|6|Surely getting up at night is the best means of subduing the self and is more suitable for uprightness in speech.
73|7|You are indeed much occupied during the day with the affairs of the world.
73|8|So remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with exclusive devotion.
73|9|He is the Lord of the East and the West; there is no god but He. So take Him alone for your Guardian,
73|10|And bear patiently the vain things they utter, and gracefully forsake them.
73|11|Leave it to Me to deal with the affluent ones who give the lie (to the Truth), and bear with them for a while.
73|12|We have heavy fetters and a blazing Fire in store for them;
73|13|and a food that chokes, and a grievous chastisement.
73|14|(They will come across all this) on the Day when the earth and the mountains shall tremble violently and the mountains shall crumble into heaps of scattered sand.
73|15|Surely We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness over you, just as We had sent a Messenger to Pharaoh.
73|16|But Pharaoh disobeyed Our Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible seizing.
73|17|If you persist in disbelieving, how will you guard yourself against the (woe of the) Day that will turn children grey-haired,
73|18|the Day whose severity shall cause the heaven to split asunder? Allah's promise is ever bound to be fulfilled.
73|19|Indeed this is nothing but a Good Counsel; so let him who will take a way leading to his Lord.
73|20|(O Prophet), your Lord knows that you sometimes stand up in Prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half or one-third of it, and so does a party of those with you; Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He has shown mercy to you. So now recite as much of the Qur'an as you can. He knows that there are among you those who are sick and others who are journeying in the land in quest of Allah's bounty, and still others who are fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you easily can, and establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and give Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah. That is better and its reward is greater. And ask for Allah's forgiveness; surely He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.
74|1|O you enveloped in your cloak!
74|2|Arise, and warn,
74|3|and magnify the glory of your Lord,
74|4|and purify your robes,
74|5|and shun uncleanness,
74|6|and bestow not favour in order to seek from others a greater return,
74|7|and persevere for your Lord's sake.
74|8|When the Trumpet shall be sounded,
74|9|that will surely be a hard day,
74|10|not an easy day for the unbelievers.
74|11|Leave Me with him whom I alone have created,
74|12|whom I have endowed with abundant riches,
74|13|and sons ever present with him,
74|14|and for whom I have smoothed the way (to power and riches),
74|15|and who still greedily desires that I should bestow upon him more.
74|16|By no means; he is stubbornly opposed to Our Signs.
74|17|I shall soon constrain him to a hard ascent.
74|18|He reflected and then hatched a scheme.
74|19|Ruin seize him, how did he hatch a scheme?
74|20|Again, ruin seize him, how did he hatch a scheme?
74|21|He looked (at others);
74|22|then frowned and scowled;
74|23|then he retreated and waxed proud,
74|24|and said: “This (Qur'an) is merely a sorcery of yore;
74|25|this is nothing but the word of a mere mortal!”
74|26|Him shall I soon roast in Hell.
74|27|And what do you know what Hell is?
74|28|It spares nothing; it leaves nothing intact;
74|29|it scorches (even) the skin.
74|30|Over it are nineteen keepers.
74|31|We have appointed none but angels as the keepers of the Fire, and We have not made their number but as a trial for the unbelievers so that those who have been endowed with the Book will be convinced and the believers' faith will increase, and neither those who have been endowed with the Book nor the believers will fall into any doubt. As for those in whose hearts there is a sickness as well as the unbelievers, they will say: “What did Allah aim at by this strange parable?” Thus does Allah let whomsoever He pleases to go astray, and directs whomsoever He pleases to the Right Way. And none knows the hosts of your Lord but He. (And Hell has only been mentioned here) that people may take heed.
74|32|Nay, by the moon,
74|33|and by the night when it recedes,
74|34|and by the day when it dawns (with its radiance),
74|35|surely (Hell) is one of the greatest Signs,
74|36|a warning to humankind,
74|37|a warning to everyone of you whether he would like to come forward or lag behind.
74|38|Each one is a hostage to one's deeds,
74|39|save the People of the Right Hand
74|40|who shall be in the Gardens, and shall ask
74|41|about the guilty ones:
74|42|“What drove you to Hell?”
74|43|They will answer: “We were not among those who observed Prayer,
74|44|and we did not feed the poor,
74|45|and we indulged in vain talk with those who indulged in vain talk,
74|46|and we gave the lie to the Day of Judgement
74|47|until the inevitable event overtook us.”
74|48|The intercession of the intercessors shall then be of no avail to them.
74|49|What is the matter with people that they are turning away from this Exhortation,
74|50|as though they were frightened wild asses,
74|51|fleeing from a lion?
74|52|No indeed; each one of them desires that open letters be sent to each of them.
74|53|No indeed; the truth is that they have no fear of the Hereafter.
74|54|Nay; this is an Exhortation.
74|55|So, whoever wills may benefit from it.
74|56|But they will not benefit from it unless Allah Himself so wills. He is worthy to be feared; and He is worthy to forgive (those that fear Him).
75|1|Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection;
75|2|and nay, I swear by the self-reproaching soul!
75|3|Does man imagine that We will not be able to bring his bones together again?
75|4|Yes indeed; We have the power to remould even his finger-tips.
75|5|But man desires to persist in his evil ways.
75|6|He asks: “When will the Day of Resurrection be?”
75|7|When the sight is dazed,
75|8|and the moon is eclipsed,
75|9|and the sun and the moon are joined together,
75|10|on that Day will man say: “Whither the refuge?”
75|11|No, there is no refuge.
75|12|With your Lord alone will be the retreat that Day.
75|13|On that Day will man be apprised of his deeds, both the earlier and the later.
75|14|But lo, man is well aware of himself,
75|15|even though he might make up excuses.
75|16|(O Prophet), do not stir your tongue hastily (to commit the Revelation to memory).
75|17|Surely it is for Us to have you commit it to memory and to recite it.
75|18|And so when We recite it, follow its recitation attentively;
75|19|then it will be for Us to explain it.
75|20|Nay; the truth is that you love ardently (the good of this world) that can be obtained hastily,
75|21|and are oblivious of the Hereafter.
75|22|Some faces on that Day will be fresh and resplendent,
75|23|and will be looking towards their Lord;
75|24|and some faces on that Day will be gloomy,
75|25|believing that a crushing calamity is about to strike them.
75|26|Nay; when a man's soul reaches up to the throat,
75|27|and it is said: “Is there any enchanter who can step forward and help (by his chanting)?”
75|28|and he realises that the hour of parting is come,
75|29|and calf is inter-twined with calf.
75|30|On that Day you will be driven to your Lord.
75|31|But he did not verify the Truth, nor did he observe Prayer;
75|32|on the contrary, he gave the lie to the Truth and turned his back upon it,
75|33|then he went back to his kinsfolk, elated with pride.
75|34|This (attitude) is worthy of you, altogether worthy;
75|35|again, it is worthy of you, altogether worthy.
75|36|Does man think that he will be left alone, unquestioned?
75|37|Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen,
75|38|then he became a clot, and then Allah made it into a living body and proportioned its parts,
75|39|and then He made of him a pair, male and female?
75|40|Does He, then, not have the power to bring back the dead to life?
76|1|Was there a period of time when man was not even worthy of a mention?
76|2|Verily We created man out of a drop of intermingled sperm so that We might try him, and We therefore endowed him with hearing and sight.
76|3|Surely We showed him the Right Path, regardless of whether he chooses to be thankful or unthankful (to his Lord).
76|4|For the unbelievers, We have kept ready chains and fetters and a Blazing Fire.
76|5|The virtuous shall drink from a cup tempered with camphor water.
76|6|This will be a gushing spring wherefrom Allah's servants shall drink wine, a spring from which they will take out channels wherever they wish.
76|7|These will be the ones who fulfil their vows and dread the Day whose woe shall be spread far and wide;
76|8|those who, for the love of Him, feed the needy, and the orphan, and the captive,
76|9|(saying): “We feed you only for Allah's sake; we do not seek of you any recompense or thanks,
76|10|we fear from our Lord a Day that shall be long and distressful.”
76|11|So Allah shall guard them against the woe of that Day, and will procure them freshness and joy,
76|12|and will reward them for their steadfastness with Paradise and robes of silk.
76|13|There they will recline on elevated couches and will be subjected neither to the burning heat of the sun nor to bitter cold.
76|14|The shades of Paradise will bend over them, and its fruits will be brought within their easy reach;
76|15|and there shall be passed around them vessels of silver and goblets of crystal,
76|16|goblets bright as crystal but made of silver, filled to exact measure.
76|17|Therein they shall be served a cup flavoured with ginger,
76|18|drawn from a spring (in Paradise) called Salsabil.
76|19|There boys of everlasting youth shall go about attending them: when you see them, you would think that they are scattered pearls.
76|20|Whitherto you look around, you will see an abundance of bliss and the glories of a great kingdom.
76|21|They [i.e., the virtuous] shall be attired in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade and will be adorned with bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them a pure wine to drink.
76|22|Behold, this is your recompense and your endeavour has been appreciated.
76|23|(O Prophet), indeed We have revealed the Qur'an to you in portions.
76|24|So persevere with the command of your Lord and do not pay any heed to the wicked and the unbelieving,
76|25|and remember the name of your Lord, morning and evening;
76|26|and prostrate yourself before Him at night, and extol His Glory during the long watches of the night.
76|27|Verily they love (the good of this world) that is hastily obtainable and are oblivious of the burdensome Day ahead of them.
76|28|We created them and strengthened their joints; and whenever We wish, We can change their faces entirely.
76|29|Verily this is an Exhortation; so let him who so will take a way to his Lord.
76|30|But your willing shall be of no avail until Allah Himself so wills. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
76|31|He admits to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases. As for the wrong-doers, He has prepared for them a grievous chastisement.
77|1|By the (winds) sent forth in quick succession,
77|2|which then blow tempestuously
77|3|and raise (clouds) and scatter them around,
77|4|then winnow them thoroughly,
77|5|and then cast (Allah's) remembrance (in people's hearts),
77|6|to serve as an excuse or a warning.
77|7|Surely what you are promised shall come to pass.
77|8|So when the stars are extinguished,
77|9|and the sky is rent asunder,
77|10|and the mountains are blown away,
77|11|and the appointed time to bring the Messengers together arrives, (then shall the promised event come to pass).
77|12|To which Day has this task been deferred?
77|13|To the Day of Judgement.
77|14|What do you know what the Day of Judgement is?
77|15|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|16|Did We not destroy many a nation of the earlier times?
77|17|And We shall cause those of later times to follow them.
77|18|Thus do We deal with the guilty.
77|19|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|20|Did We not create you of a mean fluid,
77|21|which We then placed in a secure repository
77|22|until an appointed time?
77|23|See that We had the power to do so. Great indeed is Our power to do what We will.
77|24|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|25|Did We not make the earth a receptacle,
77|26|for the living and the dead,
77|27|and did We not firmly fix towering mountains on it and give you sweet water to drink?
77|28|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|29|Proceed now towards that which you were wont to deny as false;
77|30|proceed towards the three-pronged shadow,
77|31|which neither provides (cooling) shade nor protection against the flames;
77|32|it indeed throws up sparks like castles,
77|33|which seem as though they are yellow-coloured camels.
77|34|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|35|That will be the Day on which they will not (be able to) utter a word,
77|36|nor will they be allowed to proffer excuses.
77|37|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|38|That is the Day of Judgement on which We have assembled you as well as all those who went before you.
77|39|So if you have any ploy, try it against Me!
77|40|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|41|Behold, today the God-fearing will be amidst shades and springs,
77|42|and the fruits that they desire (will be ready at hand).
77|43|Eat and drink and may every joy attend you as a reward for your deeds.
77|44|Thus do We reward those that do good.
77|45|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|46|Eat and enjoy yourselves for a while. Surely you are evil-doers.
77|47|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|48|When it is said to them: “Bow down (before Allah),” they do not bow down.
77|49|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|50|In what discourse after this (Qur'an) will they, then, believe?
78|1|About what are they asking one another?
78|2|Is it about the awesome tiding
78|3|that they are in utter disagreement?
78|4|No indeed; soon will they come to know;
78|5|again, no indeed; soon will they come to know.
78|6|Have We not spread the earth like a bed,
78|7|and fixed the mountains like pegs,
78|8|and created you in pairs (as men and women),
78|9|and made your sleep a means of repose,
78|10|and made the night a covering,
78|11|and made the day to seek livelihood,
78|12|and built above you seven strong firmaments,
78|13|and placed therein a hot, shining lamp,
78|14|and sent down abundant water from the clouds
78|15|so that We may thereby bring forth grain and vegetation,
78|16|and gardens dense with foliage?
78|17|Surely the Day of Judgement has an appointed time;
78|18|the Day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and you will come forth in multitudes;
78|19|and when the sky shall be opened up and will become all doors;
78|20|and the mountains will be set in motion and become a mirage.
78|21|Surely the Hell is an ambush,
78|22|a resort for the rebellious;
78|23|therein they shall abide for ages,
78|24|they shall taste in it no coolness, nor any pleasant drink
78|25|save boiling water and wash of the wounds;
78|26|a befitting recompense for their deeds.
78|27|For indeed they did not look forward to any reckoning,
78|28|and roundly denied Our Signs as false.
78|29|And everything have We recorded in a Book.
78|30|So taste (the fruit of your deeds). We shall only increase your torment.
78|31|Surely the state of triumph awaits the God-fearing:
78|32|gardens and vineyards,
78|33|and youthful maidens of like age,
78|34|and an overflowing cup.
78|35|Therein they shall hear no idle talk, nor any falsehood;
78|36|a recompense from your Lord and an ample reward
78|37|from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of that which is between them; the Most Merciful Lord before Whom none dare utter a word.
78|38|The Day when the Spirit and the angels are ranged row on row. None shall speak save he whom the Merciful Lord will permit; and he too will speak what is right.
78|39|That Day is sure to come. So let him who will seek a resort with his Lord.
78|40|Lo! We warn you of a chastisement near at hand; the Day when a man will look on what his own hands have sent forth, and the unbelievers shall say: “Oh would that I were utter dust.”
79|1|By those (angels) that pluck out the soul from depths,
79|2|and gently take it away;
79|3|and by those that speedily glide along (the cosmos),
79|4|and vie with the others (in carrying out their Lord's behests);
79|5|and then manage the affairs of the Universe (according to their Lord's commands).
79|6|The Day when the quaking will cause a violent convulsion,
79|7|and will be followed by another quaking.
79|8|On that Day some hearts shall tremble (with fright),
79|9|and their eyes shall be downcast with dread.
79|10|They say: “Shall we indeed be restored to life,
79|11|even after we have been reduced to bones, hollow and rotten?”
79|12|They say: “That will then be a return with a great loss!”
79|13|Surely they will need no more than a single stern blast,
79|14|and lo, they will all be in the open plain.
79|15|Has Moses' story reached you?
79|16|When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa,
79|17|and directed him: “Go to Pharaoh, he has rebelled,
79|18|and say to him: 'Are you willing to be purified,
79|19|that I may direct you to your Lord and then you hold Him in awe?'”
79|20|Then Moses (went to Pharaoh and) showed him the Great Sign;
79|21|but he denied it as false and disobeyed,
79|22|and then he turned back to have recourse to his craftiness,
79|23|and gathered his people and declared:
79|24|“I am the supreme lord of you all.”
79|25|Thereupon Allah seized him for the chastisement of the World to Come as well as of the present.
79|26|Surely there is a great lesson in it for whoever would fear (Allah).
79|27|Is it harder to create you or the heaven? But Allah built it,
79|28|and raised its vault high and proportioned it;
79|29|and covered its night with darkness and brought forth from it its day;
79|30|and thereafter spread out the earth,
79|31|and brought out of it its water and its pasture,
79|32|and firmly fixed in it mountains;
79|33|all this as provision for you and your cattle.
79|34|But when the great calamity will come about
79|35|on the Day when man will recall all his strivings,
79|36|and Hell will be brought in sight for anyone to see:
79|37|then he who transgressed
79|38|and preferred the life of this world,
79|39|most surely his abode shall be Hell.
79|40|But he who feared to stand before his Lord, and restrained himself from evil desires,
79|41|most surely his abode shall be Paradise.
79|42|They ask you about the Hour: “When will it be?”
79|43|What concern do you have to speak about that?
79|44|Its knowledge rests with your Lord.
79|45|You are only a warner to him who has a fear of it.
79|46|On the Day they see it, they will feel as though they had stayed (in the grave) no more than one evening or one morning.
80|1|He frowned and turned away
80|2|that the blind man came to him.
80|3|How could you know? Perhaps he would cleanse himself,
80|4|or he might be mindful and good counsel might avail him.
80|5|Now he who waxes indifferent,
80|6|you attend to him,
80|7|though you are not to blame if he would not cleanse himself.
80|8|But he who comes to you running,
80|9|and fears (Allah),
80|10|you pay no heed to him.
80|11|No indeed; this is only a Reminder.
80|12|So whoso wills may give heed to it.
80|13|It is contained in scrolls highly honoured,
80|14|most exalted and purified,
80|15|borne by the hands of scribes,
80|16|noble and purified.
80|17|Accursed be man! How stubbornly he denies the Truth.
80|18|Out of what did Allah create him?
80|19|Out of a sperm-drop did He create him and then determined a measure for him,
80|20|and then made the course of life easy for him,
80|21|then He caused him to die and brought him to the grave,
80|22|and then, whenever He wishes, He will raise him back to life.
80|23|Nay, but man did not fulfil what Allah had enjoined upon him.
80|24|So let man just consider his food:
80|25|We poured water, pouring it in great abundance,
80|26|and cleaved the earth, cleaving it asunder;
80|27|then caused the grain to grow out of it,
80|28|together with grapes and vegetables,
80|29|and olives and palms,
80|30|and dense orchards,
80|31|and fruits and pastures –
80|32|all this as a provision for you and your cattle.
80|33|But when the deafening cry shall be sounded
80|34|on the Day when each man shall flee from his brother,
80|35|and his mother and his father;
80|36|and his consort and his children;
80|37|on that Day each will be occupied with his own business, making him oblivious of all save himself.
80|38|Some faces on that Day shall be beaming with happiness,
80|39|and be cheerful and joyous.
80|40|Some faces on that Day shall be dust-ridden,
80|41|enveloped by darkness.
80|42|These will be the unbelievers, the wicked.
81|1|When the sun shall be folded up,
81|2|when the stars shall scatter away,
81|3|when the mountains shall be set in motion,
81|4|when the ten-months pregnant camels shall be abandoned,
81|5|when the savage beasts shall be brought together,
81|6|when the seas shall be set boiling,
81|7|when the souls shall be rejoined (with their bodies),
81|8|and when the girl-child buried alive shall be asked:
81|9|for what offence was she killed?
81|10|and when the scrolls of (men's) deeds shall be unfolded,
81|11|and when Heaven is laid bare;
81|12|and Hell is stoked,
81|13|and Paradise brought nigh:
81|14|then shall each person know what he has brought along.
81|15|No indeed; I swear by the alternating stars
81|16|that hide,
81|17|and by the night as it recedes,
81|18|and the morn as it breathes.
81|19|Verily this is the word of a noble message-bearer;
81|20|one mighty and held in honour with the Lord of the Throne;
81|21|there he is obeyed and held trustworthy.
81|22|(O people of Makkah), your companion is not mad;
81|23|he indeed saw the message-bearer on the clear horizon;
81|24|nor does he grudge (conveying this knowledge about) the Unseen;
81|25|nor is it a word of an accursed Satan.
81|26|Where to are you then heading?
81|27|It is nothing but Good Counsel for everyone in the world,
81|28|for everyone of you who wishes to follow the Straight Way;
81|29|but your wishing will not avail unless Allah, the Lord of the Universe, so wishes.
82|1|When the heaven is split asunder,
82|2|when the stars are scattered,
82|3|when the seas are made to burst forth,
82|4|and when graves are laid open,
82|5|everyone shall know all his deeds, both the earlier and the later.
82|6|O man! What has deceived you about your generous Lord
82|7|Who created you, shaped you, and made you well-proportioned,
82|8|and set you in whatever form He pleased?
82|9|No indeed; (the fact is that) you deny the Reckoning, declaring it a lie;
82|10|you do so the while there are watchers over you;
82|11|noble scribes,
82|12|who know what you do.
82|13|Surely the virtuous shall be in Bliss,
82|14|and the wicked shall be in the Blazing Fire.
82|15|They shall enter it on the Day of Recompense
82|16|and then shall never come out of it.
82|17|What do you know what the Day of Recompense is?
82|18|Again, what do you know what the Day of Recompense is?
82|19|It is the Day when no one shall have the power to do anything for another, and all command shall be Allah's.
83|1|Woe to the stinters;
83|2|those who, when they take from others by measure, take their full share;
83|3|but who, when they measure or weigh for others, give less than their due.
83|4|Do they not realise that they will be raised to life
83|5|on a Great Day,
83|6|a Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe?
83|7|No indeed! Verily the deeds of the wicked are in the Record locked up in the prison-house!
83|8|And how would you know what the Record of the prison-house is?
83|9|It is a Book inscribed.
83|10|Woe, then, to those that give the lie,
83|11|those that give the lie to the Day of Recompense.
83|12|Yet none gives the lie to it except the transgressor immersed in sin;
83|13|who, when Our verses are recited to him, says: “Mere tales of olden times!”
83|14|No indeed! The truth is that their hearts have become rusted on account of their evil deeds.
83|15|No indeed! On that Day they will be screened off from seeing their Lord,
83|16|and then they shall enter Hell,
83|17|whereafter they will be told: “This is what you used to give the lie to.”
83|18|No indeed! Verily, the deeds of the virtuous shall be in the record of the exalted ones.
83|19|And what do you know what the Record of the exalted ones is?
83|20|It is a Book inscribed,
83|21|which the angels placed near Allah to safeguard.
83|22|Verily the virtuous shall be in Bliss;
83|23|resting on couches, looking around.
83|24|You shall see upon their faces the glow of bliss.
83|25|They will be served a drink of the finest sealed wine,
83|26|whose seal is musk – so let all aspirants aspire after that –
83|27|a wine whose mixture is Tasnim,
83|28|a fountain at which the chosen ones shall drink.
83|29|Behold, the wicked were wont to laugh at the believers:
83|30|when they passed by them they winked,
83|31|and when they went back to their families, they went back jesting,
83|32|and when they saw the believers, they said: “Lo! These are the erring ones”;
83|33|(they said so although) they had not been appointed watchers over them.
83|34|But today the believers are laughing at the unbelievers;
83|35|seated upon their couches, they are looking around.
83|36|Have the unbelievers been duly rewarded for their deeds?
84|1|When the sky is rent asunder
84|2|and hearkens to the command of its Lord, doing what it should;
84|3|and when the earth is stretched out
84|4|and casts out what is within it and is emptied,
84|5|and hearkens to the command of its Lord, doing what it should.
84|6|O man, you are striving unto your Lord and you will meet Him.
84|7|Whoever is given the Record in his right hand
84|8|shall be called to an easy accounting,
84|9|and shall return to his people joyfully.
84|10|But he who is given the Record behind his back,
84|11|shall cry for “perdition,”
84|12|and will enter the Blazing Fire.
84|13|He used to live joyfully among his people,
84|14|thinking he would never revert (to Us).
84|15|But no; (how would he not revert)? His Lord was ever watching him.
84|16|Nay; I swear by the twilight;
84|17|and by the night and what it enfolds,
84|18|and by the moon, when it reaches its fullness:
84|19|you shall proceed onwards from stage to stage.
84|20|So, what is the matter with them that they do not believe,
84|21|and when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not prostrate themselves?
84|22|Instead, the unbelievers reject it, calling it a lie.
84|23|Allah knows best what they are accumulating (in their Record).
84|24|So give them the good news of a painful chastisement,
84|25|except for those who believe and do good deeds. Theirs shall be an unending reward.
85|1|By the heaven with its impregnable castles;
85|2|by the Promised Day,
85|3|and by the witness and what is witnessed:
85|4|the people of the pit were destroyed
85|5|with fire abounding in fuel,
85|6|while they sat around it,
85|7|and were witnessing what they did to the believers.
85|8|Against these they had no grudge except that they believed in Allah, the Most Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy,
85|9|to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Allah witnesses everything.
85|10|Surely those who tormented the believing men and the believing women and then did not repent, theirs shall be the chastisement of Hell, and theirs shall be the chastisement of burning.
85|11|As for those who believed and acted righteously, theirs shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the great triumph.
85|12|Stern indeed is your Lord's punishment.
85|13|He it is Who creates for the first time and He it is Who will create again,
85|14|and He is the Ever Forgiving, the Most Loving
85|15|– the Lord of the Glorious Throne,
85|16|the Executor of what He wills.
85|17|Has the story of the armies reached you,
85|18|the armies of Pharaoh and Thamud?
85|19|The unbelievers are indeed engaged in denying it, calling it a lie,
85|20|although Allah surrounds them.
85|21|Nay; but this is a glorious Qur'an,
85|22|inscribed on a well-guarded Tablet.
86|1|By the heaven, and the night-visitor,
86|2|what do you know what the night-visitor is?
86|3|It is the piercing star.
86|4|There is no living being but there is a protector over it.
86|5|So let man consider of what he was created.
86|6|He was created of a gushing fluid,
86|7|emanating from between the loins and the ribs.
86|8|Surely He (the Creator) has the power to bring him back (to life).
86|9|On the Day when man's deepest secrets shall be put to the test
86|10|he shall have no power, and no helper.
86|11|By the heaven with its recurring cycle of rain,
86|12|and by the earth ever bursting with verdure,
86|13|this (Qur'an) is surely a decisive Word,
86|14|not a flippant jest.
86|15|They are devising a guile,
86|16|and I too am devising a guile.
86|17|So leave the unbelievers to themselves; respite them awhile.
87|1|Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,
87|2|Who created all things and fashioned them in good proportion;
87|3|Who determined and guided them,
87|4|Who brought forth the pasture,
87|5|and then made it into a blackish straw.
87|6|We shall make you recite and then you will not forget,
87|7|except what Allah should wish. He knows all that is manifest and all that is hidden.
87|8|We shall ease you to follow the way of Ease.
87|9|So render good counsel if good counsel will avail.
87|10|He who fears (Allah) shall heed it,
87|11|but the wretched will turn away from it.
87|12|He will be cast into the Great Fire.
87|13|Then he will neither die in it, nor live.
87|14|He who purified himself shall prosper,
87|15|remembering his Lord's name and praying.
87|16|No; but you prefer the present life,
87|17|whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring.
87|18|This, indeed, was in the ancient Scrolls,
87|19|the Scrolls of Abraham and Moses.
88|1|Has the news of the overwhelming event reached you?
88|2|Some faces that Day shall be downcast with fear,
88|3|be toiling and worn-out;
88|4|they shall burn in a Scorching Fire;
88|5|their drink shall be from a boiling spring.
88|6|They shall have no food except bitter dry thorns
88|7|that will neither nourish nor satisfy their hunger.
88|8|On that very Day some faces shall be radiant with joy,
88|9|well-pleased with their striving.
88|10|They will be in a lofty Garden
88|11|wherein they shall hear no vain talk.
88|12|In it there shall be a flowing spring,
88|13|and couches raised high,
88|14|and goblets laid out,
88|15|and cushions arrayed in rows,
88|16|and rich carpets levelled out.
88|17|Do (these unbelievers) not observe the camels: how they were created?
88|18|And the sky: how it was raised high?
88|19|And the mountains: how they were fixed?
88|20|And the earth: how it was spread out?
88|21|So render good counsel, for you are simply required to counsel,
88|22|and are not invested with the authority to compel them.
88|23|But whoever will turn away (from the Truth),
88|24|Allah will chastise him with the most terrible chastisement.
88|25|Surely to Us is their return;
88|26|and then it is for Us to call them to account.
89|1|By the dawn,
89|2|and the ten nights,
89|3|and the even and the odd,
89|4|and by the night when it departs.
89|5|Is there in this an oath for one endowed with understanding?
89|6|Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Ad
89|7|of Iram, known for their lofty columns,
89|8|the like of whom no nation was ever created in the lands of the world?
89|9|And how did He deal with Thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley?
89|10|And with Pharaoh of the tent pegs
89|11|who transgressed in the countries of the world
89|12|spreading in them much corruption?
89|13|Then their Lord unloosed upon them the lash of chastisement.
89|14|Truly your Lord is ever watchful.
89|15|As for man, when his Lord tests him by exalting him and bestowing His bounties upon him, he says: “My Lord has exalted me.”
89|16|But when He tests him by straitening his sustenance, he says: “My Lord has humiliated me.”
89|17|But no; you do not treat the orphan honourably,
89|18|and do not urge one another to feed the poor,
89|19|and greedily devour the entire inheritance,
89|20|and love the riches, loving them ardently.
89|21|But no; when the earth is ground to powder,
89|22|and when your Lord appears with rows upon rows of angels,
89|23|and when Hell is brought near that Day. On that Day will man understand, but of what avail will that understanding be?
89|24|He will say: “Would that I had sent ahead what would be of avail for this life of mine!”
89|25|Then on that Day Allah will chastise as none other can chastise;
89|26|and Allah will bind as none other can bind.
89|27|(On the other hand it will be said): “O serene soul!
89|28|Return to your Lord well-pleased (with your blissful destination), well-pleasing (to your Lord).
89|29|So enter among My (righteous) servants
89|30|and enter My Paradise.”
90|1|Nay! I swear by this city
90|2|– this city wherein you have been rendered violable–
90|3|and I swear by the parent and his offspring:
90|4|Verily We have created man into toil and hardship.
90|5|Does he think that no one can overpower him?
90|6|He says: “I have squandered enormous wealth.”
90|7|Does he believe that none has seen him?
90|8|Did We not grant him two eyes,
90|9|and a tongue and two lips?
90|10|And did We not show him the two highroads (of good and evil)?
90|11|But he did not venture to scale the difficult steep.
90|12|And what do you know what that difficult steep is?
90|13|It is freeing someone's neck from slavery;
90|14|or giving food on a day of hunger
90|15|to an orphan near of kin;
90|16|or to a destitute lying in dust;
90|17|and, then besides this, he be one of those who believed, and enjoined upon one another steadfastness and enjoined upon one another compassion.
90|18|These are the People of the Right Hand.
90|19|As for those who rejected Our Signs, they are the People of the Left Hand.
90|20|Upon them shall be a Fire that will hem them in.
91|1|By the sun and its heat and brightness,
91|2|and by the moon as it follows it;
91|3|and by the day as it displays the sun's glory,
91|4|and by the night as it envelopes the sun;
91|5|and by the sky and by Him Who made it;
91|6|and by the earth and by Him Who stretched it out;
91|7|and by the soul and by Him Who perfectly proportioned it,
91|8|and imbued it with (the consciousness of) its evil and its piety:
91|9|He who purifies it will prosper,
91|10|and he who suppresses it will be ruined.
91|11|In their presumptuous insolence the Thamud called the Truth a lie
91|12|when their arch-criminal rose up in rage.
91|13|Then Allah's Messenger warned them: “Hands off the she-camel and her drink!”
91|14|But they rejected his statement as a lie and hamstrung the she-camel. For that crime their Lord rumbled down upon them, utterly razing them to the ground.
91|15|He has no fear of its sequel.
92|1|By the night when it enshrouds,
92|2|and by the day when it breaks in its glory,
92|3|and by Him Who created the male and the female:
92|4|surely your strivings are divergent.
92|5|As for him who gave out his wealth (for Allah's sake) and abstained (from disobeying Him),
92|6|and affirmed the Truth of goodness:
92|7|We shall facilitate for him the Way to Bliss.
92|8|As for him who was a miser and behaved with aversion (to Allah),
92|9|and denied the Truth of goodness:
92|10|We shall facilitate for him the way to Hardship,
92|11|and his wealth shall be of no avail to him when he perishes.
92|12|Surely it is for Us to show the Right Way,
92|13|and to Us belong the Next Life and the present.
92|14|I have now warned you of a Blazing Fire,
92|15|where none shall burn except the most wicked,
92|16|who rejected the Truth, calling it falsehood and turned his back on it.
92|17|But the God-fearing shall be kept away from it,
92|18|the Godfearing who spends his wealth to purify himself;
92|19|not as payment for any favours that he received,
92|20|but only to seek the good pleasure of his Lord Most High.
92|21|He will surely be well-pleased (with him).
93|1|By the bright forenoon,
93|2|and by the night when it covers the world with peace:
93|3|(O Prophet), your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased.
93|4|Indeed what is to come will be better for you than what has gone by.
93|5|Verily your Lord will soon give you so amply that you will be well-pleased.
93|6|Did He not find you an orphan and then gave you shelter?
93|7|Did He not find you unaware of the Right Way, and then directed you to it?
93|8|And did He not find you in want, and then enriched you?
93|9|Therefore, be not harsh with the orphan;
93|10|and chide not him who asks,
93|11|and proclaim the bounty of your Lord.
94|1|(O Prophet), Did We not lay open your breast
94|2|and relieve you of the burden
94|3|that had well-nigh broken your back?
94|4|And did We not exalt your fame?
94|5|Indeed, there is ease with hardship.
94|6|Most certainly, there is ease with hardship.
94|7|So, whenever you are free, strive in devotion,
94|8|and turn to your Lord with longing.
95|1|By the fig and the olive;
95|2|and by the Mount Sinai,
95|3|and by this city (of Makkah), a haven of peace:
95|4|surely We created man in the best mould;
95|5|then We reverted him to the lowest of the low,
95|6|except those who have faith and do righteous deeds. Theirs is a never ending reward.
95|7|Who, then, can give the lie to you, (O Prophet), about the Reward and the Punishment?
95|8|Is not Allah the Greatest of all sovereigns?
96|1|Recite in the name of your Lord Who created,
96|2|created man from a clot of congealed blood.
96|3|Recite: and your Lord is Most Generous,
96|4|Who taught by the pen,
96|5|taught man what he did not know.
96|6|Nay, surely man transgresses;
96|7|for he believes himself to be self-sufficient.
96|8|Surely to your Lord is your return.
96|9|Did you see him who forbids
96|10|a servant (of Allah) when he prays?
96|11|Did you consider: what if he is on the Right Way,
96|12|and enjoins piety?
96|13|Did you consider: what if he gives the lie (to the Truth) and turns away (from it)?
96|14|Does he not know that Allah sees everything?
96|15|No indeed; if he does not desist, We shall drag him by the forelock;
96|16|by the lying forelock steeped in sin.
96|17|So let him summon his helpmates;
96|18|We too shall summon the guards of Hell.
96|19|No, not at all. Never obey him. But prostrate yourself and become nigh (to your Lord).
97|1|Behold, We revealed this (Qur'an) on the Night of Power.
97|2|And what do you know what the Night of Power is?
97|3|The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.
97|4|The angels along with the Spirit descend in it by the permission of their Lord with all kinds of decrees.
97|5|All peace is that night until the rise of dawn.
98|1|Those who disbelieved – be they from the People of the Book or from those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity – will not desist from unbelief until the Clear Proof should come to them;
98|2|a Messenger from Allah, reciting from Purified Scrolls;
98|3|in writings wherein are scriptures, absolutely true and unerring.
98|4|Nor did those to whom the Book had been given split up until after the Proof (of the Right Way) had come to them.
98|5|Yet all that they had been commanded was that they serve Allah, with utter sincerity, devoting themselves exclusively to Him, and that they establish Prayer and pay Zakah. That is the Right Faith.
98|6|Those who disbelieved – be they from among the People of the Book or among those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity– shall be in the Fire, and will abide in it. They are the worst of creatures.
98|7|But those that believe and work righteous deeds, they are the best of creatures.
98|8|Their recompense lies with their Lord: Gardens of eternity beneath which rivers flow; therein they shall dwell, forever and ever. Allah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. All this is for him who fears his Lord.
99|1|When the earth will be shaken with a mighty shaking,
99|2|and the earth will throw up all her burdens,
99|3|and man will cry out: “What is the matter with her?”
99|4|On that Day it will relate all her news,
99|5|for your Lord will have commanded her (to do so).
99|6|On that Day people will go forth in varying states so that they be shown their deeds.
99|7|So, whoever does an atom's weight of good shall see it;
99|8|and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it.
100|1|By (the horses) that charge snorting,
100|2|then raise sparks of fire (by their hoofs),
100|3|then raid by the dawn,
100|4|and blaze a trail of dust,
100|5|and penetrate deep into a host.
100|6|Verily man is most ungrateful to his Lord;
100|7|and he himself is a witness to that,
100|8|and surely he loves riches with a passionate loving.
100|9|Is he not aware that when whatever lies (buried) in the graves is overthrown;
100|10|and the secrets of the hearts are laid bare (and examined)?
100|11|Surely on that Day will their Lord be fully informed about them.
101|1|The Calamity!
101|2|What is the Calamity?
101|3|And what do you know what the Calamity is?
101|4|On that Day human beings shall be like scattered moths,
101|5|and the mountains shall be like fluffs of carded wool in varying colours.
101|6|Then he whose scales weigh heavier
101|7|shall have a blissful life;
101|8|but he whose scales weigh lighter,
101|9|his shall be the deep pit for a dwelling.
101|10|And what do you know what that is?
101|11|A Blazing Fire!
102|1|The craving for ever-greater worldly gains and to excel others in that regard keeps you occupied
102|2|until you reach your graves.
102|3|Nay, you will soon come to know;
102|4|nay, again, you shall soon come to know.
102|5|Nay, would that you knew with certainty of knowledge (what your attitude will lead to, you would never have acted the way you do).
102|6|You will surely end up seeing Hell;
102|7|again, you shall most certainly end up seeing it with absolute certainty.
102|8|Then, on that Day, you will be called to account for all the bounties you enjoyed.
103|1|By the time!
103|2|Lo! Man is in a state of loss;
103|3|save those who have faith and do righteous deeds, and counsel each other to hold on to truth and counsel each other to be steadfast.
104|1|Woe to every fault-finding backbiter;
104|2|who amasses wealth and counts it over and again.
104|3|He thinks that his wealth will immortalise him forever.
104|4|Nay, he shall be thrown into the Crusher.
104|5|And what do you know what the Crusher is?
104|6|It is the Fire kindled by Allah,
104|7|the Fire that shall rise to the hearts (of criminals).
104|8|Verily it will close in upon them,
104|9|in outstretched columns.
105|1|Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephants?
105|2|Did He not bring their plan to naught?
105|3|And He sent against them swarms of birds
105|4|which smote them with stones of baked clay,
105|5|and made them like straw eaten up (by cattle).
106|1|Since the Quraysh became accustomed,
106|2|accustomed to the journey of winter and summer,
106|3|therefore, let them worship the Lord of this House;
106|4|Who fed them against hunger, and secured them against fear.
107|1|Did you see him who gives the lie to the Reward and Punishment of the Hereafter?
107|2|Such is the one who repulses the orphans away,
107|3|and urges not the feeding of the needy.
107|4|Woe, then, to those who pray,
107|5|but are heedless in their Prayers,
107|6|those who do good (in order) to be seen,
107|7|and deny people the articles of common necessity.
108|1|(O Prophet), We have surely bestowed upon you good in abundance.
108|2|So offer Prayer and sacrifice to your Lord alone.
108|3|Verily your enemy alone has been cut off from the roots.
109|1|Say: “O unbelievers!”
109|2|I do not worship those that you worship
109|3|neither do you worship Him Whom I worship;
109|4|nor will I worship those whom you have worshipped;
109|5|nor are you going to worship Him Whom I worship.
109|6|To you is your religion, and to me, my religion.
110|1|When the help comes from Allah, and victory (is granted),
110|2|and you see people entering Allah's religion in multitudes,
110|3|then extol the praise of your Lord and pray to Him for forgiveness. For He indeed is ever disposed to accept repentance.
111|1|Destroyed were the hands of Abu Lahab, and he lay utterly doomed.
111|2|His wealth did not avail him, nor his acquisitions.
111|3|Surely, he will be cast into a Flaming Fire
111|4|along with his wife, that carrier of slanderous tales;
111|5|upon her neck shall be a rope of palm-fibre.
112|1|Say: “He is Allah, the One and Unique;
112|2|Allah, Who is in need of none and of Whom all are in need;
112|3|He neither begot any nor was He begotten,
112|4|and none is comparable to Him.”
113|1|Say: “I seek refuge with the Lord of the rising day;
113|2|from the evil of all that He created;
113|3|from the evil of night's darkness when it spreads around;
113|4|from the evil of the women who blow on knots;
113|5|and from the evil of the envier when he envies.”
114|1|Say: “I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind;
114|2|the King of mankind,
114|3|the True God of mankind,
114|4|from the mischief of the whispering, elusive prompter who returns again and again,
114|5|who whispers in the hearts of people;
114|6|whether he be from the jinn or humans.”
