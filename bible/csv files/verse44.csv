"['\ufeffThe Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'All wisdom comes from the Lord, and is with him forever. \n', 'Who can count the sand of the seas, the drops of rain, and the days of eternity? \n', 'Who will search out the height of the sky, the breadth of the earth, the deep, and wisdom? \n', 'Wisdom has been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. \n', 'To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? Who has known her shrewd counsels? \n', 'There is one wise, greatly to be feared, sitting upon his throne: the Lord. \n', 'He created her. He saw and measured her. He poured her out upon all his works. \n', 'She is with all flesh according to his gift. He gave her freely to those who love him. \n', 'The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation, gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. \n', 'The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, and will give gladness, joy, and length of days. \n', 'Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last. He will be blessed in the day of his death. \n', 'To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. It was created together with the faithful in the womb. \n', 'She laid an eternal foundation with men. She will be trusted amongst their offspring. \n', 'To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom. She inebriates men with her fruits. \n', 'She will fill all her house with desirable things, and her storehouses with her produce. \n', 'The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish. \n', 'He both saw and measured her. He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, and exalted the honour of those who hold her fast. \n', 'To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom. Her branches are length of days. \n', 'Unjust wrath can never be justified, for his wrath tips the scale to his downfall. \n', 'A man that is patient will resist for a season, and afterward gladness will spring up to him. \n', 'He will hide his words until the right moment, and the lips of many will tell of his understanding. \n', 'A wise saying is in the treasures of wisdom; but godliness is an abomination to a sinner. \n', 'If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments and the Lord will give her to you freely; \n', 'for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction. Faith and humility are his good pleasure. \n', 'Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord. Don’t come to him with a double heart. \n', 'Don’t be a hypocrite in men’s sight. Keep watch over your lips. \n', 'Don’t exalt yourself, lest you fall and bring dishonour upon your soul. The Lord will reveal your secrets and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation, because you didn’t come to the fear of the Lord and your heart was full of deceit. \n']"
"['\ufeffSirach.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'My son, if you come to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for temptation. \n', 'Set your heart aright, constantly endure, and don’t make haste in time of calamity. \n', 'Cling to him, and don’t depart, that you may be increased at your latter end. \n', 'Accept whatever is brought upon you, and be patient when you suffer humiliation. \n', 'For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. \n', 'Put your trust in him, and he will help you. Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him. \n', 'All you who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy. Don’t turn aside, lest you fall. \n', 'All you who fear the Lord, put your trust in him, and your reward will not fail. \n', 'All you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, and for eternal gladness and mercy. \n', 'Look at the generations of old, and see: Who ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed? Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken? Or who called upon him, and he neglected him? \n', 'For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction. \n', 'Woe to fearful hearts, to faint hands, and to the sinner who goes two ways! \n', 'Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe. Therefore it won’t be defended. \n', 'Woe to you who have lost your patience! And what will you all do when the Lord visits you? \n', 'Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words. Those who love him will keep his ways. \n', 'Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure. Those who love him will be filled with the law. \n', 'Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and will humble their souls in his sight. \n', 'We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men; for as his majesty is, so also is his mercy. \n']"
"['\ufeffSirach.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'Hear me, your father, O my children, and do what you hear, that you all may be safe. \n', 'For the Lord honours the father over the children, and has confirmed the judgement of the mother over her sons. \n', 'He who honours his father will make atonement for sins. \n', 'He who gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure. \n', 'Whoever honours his father will have joy in his own children. He will be heard in the day of his prayer. \n', 'He who gives glory to his father will have length of days. He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother, \n', 'and will serve under his parents, as to masters. \n', 'Honour your father in deed and word, that a blessing may come upon you from him. \n', 'For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children, but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations. \n', 'Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonour of your father, for your father’s dishonour is no glory to you. \n', 'For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to her children. \n', 'My son, help your father in his old age, and don’t grieve him as long as he lives. \n', 'If he fails in understanding, have patience with him. Don’t dishonour him in your full strength. \n', 'For the kindness to your father will not be forgotten. Instead of sins it will be added to build you up. \n', 'In the day of your affliction it will be remembered for you, as fair weather upon ice, so your sins will also melt away. \n', 'He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer. He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord. \n', 'My son, go on with your business in humility; so you will be loved by an acceptable man. \n', 'The greater you are, humble yourself the more, and you will find favour before the Lord. \n', 'For the power of the Lord is great, and he is glorified by those who are lowly. \n', 'Don’t seek things that are too hard for you, and don’t search out things that are above your strength. \n', 'Think about the things that have been commanded you, for you have no need of the things that are secret. \n', 'Don’t be overly busy in tasks that are beyond you, for more things are shown to you than men can understand. \n', 'For the conceit of many has led them astray. Evil opinion has caused their judgement to slip. \n', 'There is no light without eyes. There is no wisdom without knowledge. \n', 'A stubborn heart will do badly at the end. He who loves danger will perish in it. \n', 'A stubborn heart will be burdened with troubles. The sinner will heap sin upon sins. \n', 'The calamity of the proud has no healing, for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him. \n', 'The heart of the prudent will understand a proverb. A wise man desires the ear of a listener. \n', 'Water will quench a flaming fire; almsgiving will make atonement for sins. \n', 'He who repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward. In the time of his falling he will find a support. \n']"
"['\ufeffSirach.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living. Don’t make the needy eyes wait long. \n', 'Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful, or provoke a man in his distress. \n', 'Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked. Don’t put off giving to him who is in need. \n', 'Don’t reject a suppliant in his affliction. Don’t turn your face away from a poor man. \n', 'Don’t turn your eye away from one who asks. Give no occasion to a man to curse you. \n', 'For if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul, he who made him will hear his supplication. \n', 'Endear yourself to the assembly. Bow your head to a great man. \n', 'Incline your ear to a poor man. Answer him with peaceful words in humility. \n', 'Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of him who wrongs him; Don’t be hesitant in giving judgement. \n', 'Be as a father to the fatherless, and like a husband to their mother. So you will be as a son of the Most High, and he will love you more than your mother does. \n', 'Wisdom exalts her sons, and takes hold of those who seek her. \n', 'He who loves her loves life. Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness. \n', 'He who holds her fast will inherit glory. Where he enters, the Lord will bless. \n', 'Those who serve her minister to the Holy One. The Lord loves those who love her. \n', 'He who listens to her will judge the nations. He who heeds her will dwell securely. \n', 'If he trusts her, he will inherit her, and his generations will possess her. \n', 'For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways, and will bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgements. \n', 'Then she will return him again to the straight way, and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets. \n', 'If he goes astray, she will forsake him, and hand him over to his fall. \n', 'Watch for the opportunity, and beware of evil. Don’t be ashamed of your soul. \n', 'For there is a shame that brings sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace. \n', 'Don’t show partiality, discrediting your soul. Don’t revere any man to your falling. \n', 'Don’t refrain from speaking when it is for safety. Don’t hide your wisdom for the sake of seeming fair. \n', 'For wisdom will be known by speech, and instruction by the word of the tongue. \n', 'Don’t speak against the truth and be shamed for your ignorance. \n', 'Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins. Don’t fight the river’s current. \n', 'Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon. Don’t be partial to one who is mighty. \n', 'Strive for the truth to death, and the Lord God will fight for you. \n', 'Don’t be hasty with your tongue, or slack and negligent in your deeds. \n', 'Don’t be like a lion in your house, or suspicious of your servants. \n', 'Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive, and closed when you should repay. \n']"
"['\ufeffSirach.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'Don’t set your heart upon your goods. Don’t say, “They are sufficient for me.” \n', 'Don’t follow your own mind and your strength to walk in the desires of your heart. \n', 'Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?” for the Lord will surely take vengeance on you. \n', 'Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?” for the Lord is patient. \n', 'Don’t be so confident of atonement that you add sin upon sins. \n', 'Don’t say, “His compassion is great. He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,” for mercy and wrath are with him, and his indignation will rest on sinners. \n', 'Don’t wait to turn to the Lord. Don’t put off from day to day; for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you, and you will perish in the time of vengeance. \n', 'Don’t set your heart upon unrighteous gains, for you will profit nothing in the day of calamity. \n', 'Don’t winnow with every wind. Don’t walk in every path. This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does. \n', 'Be steadfast in your understanding. Let your speech be consistent. \n', 'Be swift to hear and answer with patience. \n', 'If you have understanding, answer your neighbour; but if not, put your hand over your mouth. \n', 'Glory and dishonour is in talk. A man’s tongue may be his downfall. \n', 'Don’t be called a whisperer. Don’t lie in wait with your tongue; for shame is on the thief, and an evil condemnation is on him who has a double tongue. \n', 'Don’t be ignorant in a great or small matter. \n']"
"['\ufeffSirach.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', 'Don’t become an enemy instead of a friend; for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach. So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue. \n', 'Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul, that your soul not be torn in pieces like a bull. \n', 'You will eat up your leaves, destroy your fruit, and leave yourself like a dry tree. \n', 'A wicked soul will destroy him who has it, and will make him a laughing stock to his enemies. \n', 'Sweet words will multiply a man’s friends. A gracious tongue will multiply courtesies. \n', 'Let those that are at peace with you be many, but your advisers one of a thousand. \n', 'If you want to gain a friend, get him in a time of testing, and don’t be in a hurry to trust him. \n', 'For there is a friend just for an occasion. He won’t continue in the day of your affliction. \n', 'And there is a friend who turns into an enemy. He will discover strife to your reproach. \n', 'And there is a friend who is a companion at the table, but he won’t continue in the day of your affliction. \n', 'In your prosperity he will be as yourself, and will be bold over your servants. \n', 'If you are brought low, he will be against you, and will hide himself from your face. \n', 'Separate yourself from your enemies, and beware of your friends. \n', 'A faithful friend is a strong defence. He who has found him has found a treasure. \n', 'There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend. His excellency is beyond price. \n', 'A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine. Those who fear the Lord will find him. \n', 'He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly; for as he is, so is his neighbour also. \n', 'My son, gather instruction from your youth up. Even when you have grey hair you will find wisdom. \n', 'Come to her as one who ploughs and sows and wait for her good fruit; for your toil will be little in her cultivation, and you will soon eat of her fruit. \n', 'How exceedingly harsh she is to the unlearned! He who is without understanding will not remain in her. \n', 'She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial. He won’t hesitate to cast her from him. \n', 'For wisdom is according to her name. She isn’t manifest to many. \n', 'Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement. Don’t refuse my counsel. \n', 'Bring your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her chain. \n', 'Put your shoulder under her and bear her. Don’t be grieved with her bonds. \n', 'Come to her with all your soul. Keep her ways with your whole power. \n', 'Search and seek, and she will be made known to you. When you get hold of her, don’t let her go. \n', 'For at the last you will find her rest; and she will be turned for you into gladness. \n', 'Her fetters will be to you for a covering of strength, and her chains for a robe of glory. \n', 'For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are a purple cord. \n', 'You shall put her on as a robe of glory, and shall put her on as a crown of rejoicing. \n', 'My son, if you are willing, you will be instructed. If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent. \n', 'If you love to hear, you will receive. If you incline your ear, you will be wise. \n', 'Stand in the multitude of the elders. Attach yourself to whomever is wise. \n', 'Be willing to listen to every godly discourse. Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you. \n', 'If you see a man of understanding, get to him early. Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors. \n', 'Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually on his commandments. He will establish your heart and your desire for wisdom will be given to you. \n']"
"['\ufeffSirach.\n', 'Chapter 7.\n', 'Do no evil, so no evil will overtake you. \n', 'Depart from wrong, and it will turn away from you. \n', 'My son, don’t sow upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and you won’t reap them sevenfold. \n', 'Don’t seek preeminence from the Lord, nor the seat of honour from the king. \n', 'Don’t justify yourself in the presence of the Lord, and don’t display your wisdom before the king. \n', 'Don’t seek to be a judge, lest you not be able to take away iniquities, lest perhaps you fear the person of a mighty man, and lay a stumbling block in the way of your uprightness. \n', 'Don’t sin against the multitude of the city.
