"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. \n', 'The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters. \n', 'God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. \n', 'God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. \n', 'God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day. \n', 'God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” \n', 'God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. \n', 'God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day. \n', 'God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. \n', 'God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good. \n', 'God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so. \n', 'The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. \n', 'There was evening and there was morning, a third day. \n', 'God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; \n', 'and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so. \n', 'God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. \n', 'God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, \n', 'and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. \n', 'There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. \n', 'God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” \n', 'God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. \n', 'God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” \n', 'There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. \n', 'God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. \n', 'God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good. \n', 'God said, “Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” \n', 'God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. \n', 'God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” \n', 'God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. \n', 'To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so. \n', 'God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished. \n', 'On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. \n', 'God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done. \n', 'This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. \n', 'No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground, \n', 'but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. \n', 'The LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. \n', 'The LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. \n', 'Out of the ground the LORD God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. \n', 'A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers. \n', 'The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; \n', 'and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there. \n', 'The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. \n', 'The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. \n', 'The LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. \n', 'The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; \n', 'but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.” \n', 'The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to him.” \n', 'Out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name. \n', 'The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him. \n', 'The LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. \n', 'The LORD God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. \n', 'The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” \n', 'Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. \n', 'The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?” \n', 'The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, \n', 'but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’” \n', 'The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die, \n', 'for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” \n', 'When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too. \n', 'Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves. \n', 'They heard the LORD God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. \n', 'The LORD God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” \n', 'The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.” \n', 'God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” \n', 'The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” \n', 'The LORD God said to the woman, “What have you done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” \n', 'The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. You shall go on your belly and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. \n', 'I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.” \n', 'To the woman he said, “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. You will bear children in pain. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.” \n', 'To Adam he said, “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice, and have eaten from the tree, about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ the ground is cursed for your sake. You will eat from it with much labour all the days of your life. \n', 'It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field. \n', 'You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground, for you were taken out of it. For you are dust, and you shall return to dust.” \n', 'The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living. \n', 'The LORD God made garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them. \n', 'The LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—” \n', 'Therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. \n', 'So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with the LORD’s help.” \n', 'Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. \n', 'As time passed, Cain brought an offering to the LORD from the fruit of the ground. \n', 'Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. The LORD respected Abel and his offering, \n', 'but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. \n', 'The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? \n', 'If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.” \n', 'Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him. \n', 'The LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” \n', 'The LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground. \n', 'Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. \n', 'From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” \n', 'Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. \n', 'Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.” \n', 'The LORD said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” The LORD appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him. \n', 'Cain left the LORD’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. \n', 'Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch. \n', 'Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. \n', 'Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. \n', 'Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. \n', 'His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe. \n', 'Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah. \n', 'Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me. \n', 'If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times.” \n', 'Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.” \n', 'A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the LORD’s name. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God’s likeness. \n', 'He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, he named them Adam. \n', 'Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. \n', 'The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, then he died. \n', 'Seth lived one hundred and five years, then became the father of Enosh. \n', 'Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All of the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, then he died. \n', 'Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. \n', 'Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All of the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, then he died. \n', 'Kenan lived seventy years, then became the father of Mahalalel. \n', 'Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters \n', 'and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, then he died. \n', 'Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared. \n', 'Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All of the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, then he died. \n', 'Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, then became the father of Enoch. \n', 'Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All of the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, then he died. \n', 'Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah. \n', 'After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n', 'All the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. \n', 'Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him. \n', 'Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, then became the father of Lamech. \n', 'Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, then he died. \n', 'Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, then became the father of a son. \n', 'He named him Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which the LORD has cursed.” \n', 'Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred and ninety-five years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. \n', 'All the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, then he died. \n', 'Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', 'When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them, \n', 'God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives. \n', 'The LORD said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred and twenty years.” \n', 'The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and had children with them.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 8.\n', 'God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth.

Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.” \n', 'But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, the LORD being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city. \n', 'It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!” \n', 'Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord. \n', 'See now, your servant has found favour in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. \n', 'See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.” \n', 'He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. \n', 'Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. \n', 'The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. \n', 'Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the LORD out of the sky. \n', 'He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. \n', 'But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. \n', 'Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD. \n', 'He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. \n', 'When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived. \n', 'Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. \n', 'The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. \n', 'Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” \n', 'They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose. \n', 'It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” \n', 'They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up. \n', 'Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father. \n', 'The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. \n', 'The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 20.\n', 'Abraham travelled from there towards the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar. \n', 'Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. \n', 'But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.” \n', 'Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation? \n', 'Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.” \n', 'God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her. \n', 'Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.” \n', 'Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared. \n', 'Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!” \n', 'Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?” \n', 'Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’ \n', 'Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. \n', 'When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’” \n', 'Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. \n', 'Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.” \n', 'To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.” \n', 'Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children. \n', 'For the LORD had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 21.\n', 'The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken. \n', 'Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. \n', 'Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. \n', 'Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. \n', 'Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him. \n', 'Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” \n', 'She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.” \n', 'The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. \n', 'Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. \n', 'Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.” \n', 'The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. \n', 'God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac. \n', 'I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.” \n', 'Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. \n', 'The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs. \n', 'She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. \n', 'God heard the voice of the boy. The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. \n', 'Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.” \n', 'God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink. \n', 'God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as he grew up, he became an archer. \n', 'He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt. \n', 'At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do. \n', 'Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.” \n', 'Abraham said, “I will swear.” \n', 'Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. \n', 'Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.” \n', 'Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant. \n', 'Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. \n', 'Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by themselves, mean?” \n', 'He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.” \n', 'Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore an oath there. \n', 'So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. \n', 'Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. \n', 'Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 22.\n', 'After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.” \n', 'He said, “Now take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.” \n', 'Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him. \n', 'On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. \n', 'Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.” \n', 'Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together. \n', 'Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” \n', 'Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together. \n', 'They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood. \n', 'Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son. \n', 'The LORD’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.” \n', 'He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” \n', 'Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. \n', 'Abraham called the name of that place “The LORD Will Provide”. As it is said to this day, “On the LORD’s mountain, it will be provided.” \n', 'The LORD’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky, \n', 'and said, “‘I have sworn by myself,’ says the LORD, ‘because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son, \n', 'that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies. \n', 'All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.’” \n', 'So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba. \n', 'After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor: \n', 'Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, \n', 'Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” \n', 'Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. \n', 'His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 23.\n', 'Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life. \n', 'Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. \n', 'Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, \n', '“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” \n', 'The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, \n', '“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God amongst us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.” \n', 'Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth. \n', 'He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, \n', 'that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me amongst you as a possession for a burial place.” \n', 'Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, \n', '“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.” \n', 'Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. \n', 'He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.” \n', 'Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, \n', '“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.” \n', 'Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard. \n', 'So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded \n', 'to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. \n', 'After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. \n', 'The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 24.\n', 'Abraham was old, and well advanced in age. The LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. \n', 'Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh. \n', 'I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, amongst whom I live. \n', 'But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.” \n', 'The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?” \n', 'Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again. \n', 'The LORD, the God of heaven—who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring—he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. \n', 'If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.” \n', 'The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. \n', 'The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. \n', 'He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. \n', 'He said, “The LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. \n', 'Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. \n', 'Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ then she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.” \n', 'Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder. \n', 'The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. \n', 'The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.” \n', 'She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink. \n', 'When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.” \n', 'She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. \n', 'The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. \n', 'As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, \n', 'and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay?” \n', 'She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” \n', 'She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.” \n', 'The man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD. \n', 'He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth towards my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.” \n', 'The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. \n', 'Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. \n', 'When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. \n', 'He said, “Come in, you blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.” \n', 'The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. \n', 'Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” Laban said, “Speak on.” \n', 'He said, “I am Abraham’s servant. \n', 'The LORD has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. The LORD has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys. \n', 'Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him. \n', 'My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, \n', 'but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ \n', 'I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ \n', 'He said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house. \n', 'Then you will be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’ \n', 'I came today to the spring, and said, ‘The LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go— \n', 'behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,” \n', 'then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’ \n', 'Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder.

If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.” \n', 'Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from the LORD. We can’t speak to you bad or good. \n', 'Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as the LORD has spoken.” \n', 'When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to the LORD. \n', 'The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. \n', 'They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night.

They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way. \n', 'Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South. \n', 'Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming. \n', 'Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel. \n', 'She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” She took her veil, and covered herself. \n', 'The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. \n', 'Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife.

In your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed, \n', 'because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” \n', 'Isaac lived in Gerar. \n', 'The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.” \n', 'When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife. \n', 'Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’” \n', 'Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!” \n', 'Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.” \n', 'Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. The LORD blessed him. \n', 'The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. \n', 'He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him. \n', 'Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. \n', 'Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.” \n', 'Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there. \n', 'Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them. \n', 'Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing water. \n', 'The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. \n', 'They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. So he called its name Sitnah. \n', 'He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. So he called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” \n', 'He went up from there to Beersheba. \n', 'The LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham’s sake.” \n', 'He built an altar there, and called on the LORD’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well. \n', 'Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. \n', 'Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?” \n', 'They said, “We saw plainly that the LORD was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let’s make a covenant with you, \n', 'that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of the LORD.” \n', 'He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. \n', 'They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. \n', 'The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” \n', 'He called it “Shibah”. Therefore the name of the city is “Beersheba” to this day. \n', 'When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. \n', 'They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 27.\n', 'When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?” He said to him, “Here I am.” \n', 'He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death. \n', 'Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison. \n', 'Make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.” \n', 'Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. \n', 'Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, \n', '‘Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.’ \n', 'Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. \n', 'Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savoury food for your father, such as he loves. \n', 'You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.” \n', 'Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. \n', 'What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.” \n', 'His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.” \n', 'He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savoury food, such as his father loved. \n', 'Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. \n', 'She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck. \n', 'She gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. \n', 'He came to his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” \n', 'Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.” \n', 'Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He said, “Because the LORD your God gave me success.” \n', 'Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.” \n', 'Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” \n', 'He didn’t recognise him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. \n', 'He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.” \n', 'He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.” He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank. \n', 'His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.” \n', 'He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed. \n', 'God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine. \n', 'Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you.” \n', 'As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. \n', 'He also made savoury food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.” \n', 'Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” \n', 'Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.” \n', 'When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.” \n', 'He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.” \n', 'He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?” \n', 'Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?” \n', 'Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. \n', 'Isaac his father answered him, “Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the sky from above. \n', 'You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.” \n', 'Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.” \n', 'The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. \n', 'Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran. \n', 'Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away— \n', 'until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?” \n', 'Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?” \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 28.\n', 'Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. \n', 'Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. \n', 'May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples, \n', 'and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.” \n', 'Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother. \n', 'Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;” \n', 'and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. \n', 'Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father. \n', 'So Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife. \n', 'Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went towards Haran. \n', 'He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. \n', 'He dreamt and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. \n', 'Behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give the land you lie on to you and to your offspring. \n', 'Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed. \n', 'Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.” \n', 'Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I didn’t know it.” \n', 'He was afraid, and said, “How awesome this place is! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.” \n', 'Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. \n', 'He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. \n', 'Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, \n', 'so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and the LORD will be my God, \n', 'then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 29.\n', 'Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. \n', 'He looked, and saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it.

They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well’s mouth in its place. \n', 'Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?” They said, “We are from Haran.” \n', 'He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.” \n', 'He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.” \n', 'He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.” \n', 'They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.” \n', 'While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them. \n', 'When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. \n', 'Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. \n', 'Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father. \n', 'When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things. \n', 'Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed with him for a month. \n', 'Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?” \n', 'Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. \n', 'Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. \n', 'Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.” \n', 'Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.” \n', 'Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her. \n', 'Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.” \n', 'Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. \n', 'In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her. \n', 'Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant. \n', 'In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” \n', 'Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. \n', 'Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.” \n', 'Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. \n', 'Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant. \n', 'He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years. \n', 'The LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. \n', 'Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 30.\n', 'When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister.

The LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?” \n', 'Laban said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it. \n', 'I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one amongst the sheep, and the spotted and speckled amongst the goats.

Every one that is not speckled and spotted amongst the goats, and black amongst the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.” \n', 'Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.” \n', 'That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones amongst the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. \n', 'He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. \n', 'Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. \n', 'He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. \n', 'The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. \n', 'Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 31.\n', 'Jacob heard Laban’s sons’ words, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s.

If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked. \n', 'Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me. \n', 'During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leapt on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. \n', 'The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ \n', 'He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. \n', 'I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’” \n', 'Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? \n', 'Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him?

Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.” \n', 'Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, \n', 'and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. \n', 'Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s. \n', 'Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away. \n', 'So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face towards the mountain of Gilead. \n', 'Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. \n', 'He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. \n', 'God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.” \n', 'Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. \n', 'Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? \n', 'Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; \n', 'and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. \n', 'It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’ \n', 'Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?” \n', 'Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’ \n', 'Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them. \n', 'Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent. \n', 'Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them. \n', 'She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim. \n', 'Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? \n', 'Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two. \n', '“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks. \n', 'That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. \n', 'This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. \n', 'These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. \n', 'Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked you last night.” \n', 'Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? \n', 'Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you.” \n', 'Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. \n', 'Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap. \n', 'Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. \n', 'Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed \n', 'and Mizpah, for he said, “The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another. \n', 'If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.” \n', 'Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. \n', 'May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. \n', 'The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. \n', 'Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. \n', 'Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 32.\n', 'Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. \n', 'When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim. \n', 'Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. \n', 'He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now. \n', 'I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in your sight.’” \n', 'The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” \n', 'Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies. \n', 'He said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.” \n', 'Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’ \n', 'I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. \n', 'Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children. \n', 'You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’” \n', 'He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother: \n', 'two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, \n', 'thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. \n', 'He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.” \n', 'He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’ \n', 'Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’” \n', 'He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. \n', 'You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.” \n', 'So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp. \n', 'He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. \n', 'He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. \n', 'Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. \n', 'When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled. \n', 'The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.” Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.” \n', 'He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob”. \n', 'He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.” \n', 'Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” So he blessed him there. \n', 'Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” \n', 'The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. \n', 'Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 33.\n', 'Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants. \n', 'He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. \n', 'He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. \n', 'Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. \n', 'He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” \n', 'Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves. \n', 'Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves. \n', 'Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob said, “To find favour in the sight of my lord.” \n', 'Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.” \n', 'Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favour in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me. \n', 'Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it. \n', 'Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.” \n', 'Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. \n', 'Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.” \n', 'Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.” He said, “Why? Let me find favour in the sight of my lord.” \n', 'So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. \n', 'Jacob travelled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. \n', 'Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. \n', 'He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. \n', 'He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 34.\n', 'Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. \n', 'Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her. \n', 'His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady. \n', 'Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.” \n', 'Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. \n', 'Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him. \n', 'The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done. \n', 'Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. \n', 'Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. \n', 'You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.” \n', 'Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favour in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give. \n', 'Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.” \n', 'The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, \n', 'and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us. \n', 'Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised, \n', 'then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. \n', 'But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone.” \n', 'Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. \n', 'The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honoured above all the house of his father. \n', 'Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying, \n', '“These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters. \n', 'Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male amongst us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. \n', 'Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.” \n', 'All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. \n', 'On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males. \n', 'They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. \n', 'Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. \n', 'They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field, \n', 'and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house. \n', 'Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, amongst the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.” \n', 'They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?” \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 35.\n', 'God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there.

I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.” \n', 'They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. \n', 'They travelled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob. \n', 'So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. \n', 'He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. \n', 'Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth. \n', 'God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. \n', 'God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.” He named him Israel. \n', 'God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply.

He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. \n', 'Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him “Bethel”. \n', 'They travelled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labour. \n', 'When she was in hard labour, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another son.” \n', 'As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin. \n', 'Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem). \n', 'Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day. \n', 'Israel travelled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. \n', 'While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 37.\n', 'Jacob lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. \n', 'This is the history of the generations of Jacob.

His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamt? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to the earth before you?” \n', 'His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind. \n', 'His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. \n', 'Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.” \n', 'He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. \n', 'A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 38.\n', 'At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. \n', 'There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua.

Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.” Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burnt.” \n', 'When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.” \n', 'Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.” He knew her again no more. \n', 'In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb. \n', 'When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.” \n', 'As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez. \n', 'Afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 39.\n', 'Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there. \n', 'The LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. \n', 'His master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did prosper in his hand. \n', 'Joseph found favour in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. \n', 'From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. The LORD’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. \n', 'He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. Joseph was well-built and handsome. \n', 'After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.” \n', 'But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. \n', 'No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” \n', 'As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. \n', 'About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside. \n', 'She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. \n', 'When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, \n', 'she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. \n', 'When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” \n', 'She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. \n', 'She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, \n', 'and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” \n', 'When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled. \n', 'Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. \n', 'But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. \n', 'The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. \n', 'The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because the LORD was with him; and that which he did, the LORD made it prosper. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 40.\n', 'After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. \n', 'Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker. \n', 'He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. \n', 'The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days. \n', 'They both dreamt a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. \n', 'Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. \n', 'He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?” \n', 'They said to him, “We have dreamt a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.” Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.” \n', 'The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me, \n', 'and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. \n', 'Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” \n', 'Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. \n', 'Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer. \n', 'But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. \n', 'For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.” \n', 'When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. \n', 'In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.” \n', 'Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. \n', 'Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.” \n', 'On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker amongst his servants. \n', 'He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; \n', 'but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. \n', 'Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 41.\n', 'At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamt, and behold, he stood by the river. \n', 'Behold, seven cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass. \n', 'Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. \n', 'The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. \n', 'He slept and dreamt a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good. \n', 'Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. \n', 'The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. \n', 'In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh. \n', 'Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today. \n', 'Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, with the chief baker. \n', 'We dreamt a dream in one night, he and I. Each man dreamt according to the interpretation of his dream. \n', 'There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream. \n', 'As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.” \n', 'Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. \n', 'Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamt a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” \n', 'Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.” \n', 'Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river; \n', 'and behold, seven fat and sleek cattle came up out of the river. They fed in the marsh grass; \n', 'and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. \n', 'The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle; \n', 'and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke. \n', 'I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good; \n', 'and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. \n', 'The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.” \n', 'Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh. \n', 'The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one. \n', 'The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine. \n', 'That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. \n', 'Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming. \n', 'Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, \n', 'and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous. \n', 'The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. \n', '“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. \n', 'Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years. \n', 'Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. \n', 'The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.” \n', 'The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. \n', 'Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?” \n', 'Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you. \n', 'You shall be over my house. All my people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.” \n', 'Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” \n', 'Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck. \n', 'He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt. \n', 'Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” \n', 'Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. \n', 'Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. \n', 'In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. \n', 'He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from the fields around that city. \n', 'Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number. \n', 'To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. \n', 'Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.” \n', 'The name of the second, he called Ephraim: “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” \n', 'The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. \n', 'The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. \n', 'When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.” \n', 'The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. \n', 'All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth. \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 42.\n', 'Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” \n', 'He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.” \n', 'Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. \n', 'But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.” \n', 'The sons of Israel came to buy amongst those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. \n', 'Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth. \n', 'Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognised them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?” They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” \n', 'Joseph recognised his brothers, but they didn’t recognise him. \n', 'Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamt about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.” \n', 'They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. \n', 'We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.” \n', 'He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!” \n', 'They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.” \n', 'Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ \n', 'By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here. \n', 'Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” \n', 'He put them all together into custody for three days. \n', 'Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. \n', 'If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses. \n', 'Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.” They did so. \n', 'They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.” \n', 'Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.” \n', 'They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. \n', 'He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from amongst them, and bound him before their eyes. \n', 'Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them. \n', 'They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. \n', 'As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. \n', 'He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?” \n', 'They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying, \n', '“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. \n', 'We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies. \n', 'We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’ \n', 'The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way. \n', 'Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’” \n', 'As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. \n', 'Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.” \n', 'Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.” \n', 'He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol.” \n']"
"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 43.\n', 'The famine was severe in the land. \n', 'When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.” \n', 'Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ \n', 'If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food; \n', 'but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’” \n', 'Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?” \n', 'They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’” \n', 'Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. \n', 'I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever; \n', 'for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.” \n', 'Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; \n', 'and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. \n', 'Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man. \n', 'May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.” \n', 'The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. \n', 'When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.” \n', 'The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house. \n', 'The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” \n', 'They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house, \n', 'and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food. \n', 'When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand. \n', 'We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.” \n', 'He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them. \n', 'The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. \n', 'They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there. \n', 'When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him. \n', 'He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?” \n', 'They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly. \n', 'He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.” \n', 'Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep.

"['Genesis.\n', 'Chapter 44.\n', 'He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth. \n', 'Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. \n', 'As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. \n', 'When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good? \n', 'Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’” \n', 'He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them. \n', 'They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these?

Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. \n', 'It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.” \n', 'They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favour in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” \n', 'Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth.
