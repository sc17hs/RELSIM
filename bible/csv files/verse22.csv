Beloved They are right to love you. \n', 'I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem, like Kedar’s tents, like Solomon’s curtains. \n', 'Don’t stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me. My mother’s sons were angry with me. They made me keeper of the vineyards. I haven’t kept my own vineyard. \n', 'Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock, where you rest them at noon; for why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions? \n', 'If you don’t know, most beautiful amongst women, follow the tracks of the sheep.

I sat down under his shadow with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste. \n', 'He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love. \n', 'Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am faint with love. \n', 'His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me. \n', 'I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires. \n', 'The voice of my beloved!

I sought him, but I didn’t find him. \n', 'The watchmen who go about the city found me; “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?” \n', 'I had scarcely passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, into the room of her who conceived me. \n', 'I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up nor awaken love, until it so desires. \n', 'Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all spices of the merchant? \n', 'Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage! Sixty mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of Israel. \n', 'They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.

There is no spot in you. \n', 'Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards. \n', 'You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride. You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck. \n', 'How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!

Indeed, must I put it on? I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them? \n', 'My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. My heart pounded for him. \n', 'I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock. \n', 'I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left, and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke.

He browses amongst the lilies. \n', 'You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. \n', 'Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead. \n', 'Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up from the washing, of which every one has twins; not one is bereaved amongst them. \n', 'Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. \n', 'There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins without number. \n', 'My dove, my perfect one, is unique.

Return, return, that we may gaze at you. Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, as at the dance of Mahanaim? \n']"
"['\ufeffSong of Solomon.\n', 'Chapter 7.\n', 'How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilful workman. \n', 'Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed wine is wanting. Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies. \n', 'Your two breasts are like two fawns, that are twins of a roe. \n', 'Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks towards Damascus. \n', 'Your head on you is like Carmel. The hair of your head like purple. The king is held captive in its tresses. \n', 'How beautiful and how pleasant you are, love, for delights! \n', 'This, your stature, is like a palm tree, your breasts like its fruit. \n', 'I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of its fruit.” Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the smell of your breath like apples. \n', 'Your mouth is like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of those who are asleep. \n', 'I am my beloved’s. His desire is towards me. \n', 'Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field. Let’s lodge in the villages. \n', 'Let’s go early up to the vineyards.

At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have stored up for you, my beloved. \n']"
"['\ufeffSong of Solomon.\n', 'Chapter 8.\n', 'Oh that you were like my brother, who nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I would kiss you; yes, and no one would despise me. \n', 'I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother, who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. \n', 'His left hand would be under my head.

Beloved Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother conceived you. There she was in labour and bore you. \n', 'Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm; for love is strong as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of the LORD. \n', 'Many waters can’t quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned. \n', 'We have a little sister. She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for? \n', 'If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar. \n', 'I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes like one who found peace. \n', 'Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. \n', 'My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are for you, Solomon, two hundred for those who tend its fruit. \n', 'You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice! \n', 'Come away, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices! \n']"
