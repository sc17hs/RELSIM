"['\ufeffThe Second Book of Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'Solomon the son of David was firmly established in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and made him exceedingly great. \n', 'Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households. \n', 'Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which the LORD’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness. \n', 'But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. \n', 'Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before the LORD’s tabernacle; and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there. \n', 'Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it. \n', 'That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for what you want me to give you.” \n', 'Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place. \n', 'Now, LORD God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. \n', 'Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?” \n', 'God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honour, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king, \n', 'therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you, and none after you will have.” \n', 'So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. \n', 'Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. \n', 'The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. \n', 'The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue. \n', 'They imported from Egypt then exported a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty. They also exported them to the Hittite kings and the Syrian kings. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'Now Solomon decided to build a house for the LORD’s name, and a house for his kingdom. \n', 'Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. \n', 'Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me. \n', 'Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, to burn before him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel. \n', '“The house which I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. \n', 'But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him? \n', '“Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skilful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. \n', '“Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants, \n', 'even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful. \n', 'Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.” \n', 'Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them.” \n', 'Huram continued, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for the LORD and a house for his kingdom. \n', 'Now I have sent a skilful man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi, \n', 'the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre. He is skilful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, in timber, in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device, that there may be a place appointed to him with your skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David your father. \n', '“Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants; \n', 'and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; then you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.” \n', 'Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred. \n', 'He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to assign the people their work. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'Then Solomon began to build the LORD’s house at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. \n', 'He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. \n', 'Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house: the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits. \n', 'The porch that was in front, its length, across the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold. \n', 'He made the larger room with a ceiling of cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. \n', 'He decorated the house with precious stones for beauty. The gold was gold from Parvaim. \n', 'He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls. \n', 'He made the most holy place. Its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. \n', 'The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold. \n', 'In the most holy place he made two cherubim by carving, and they overlaid them with gold. \n', 'The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. \n', 'The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub. \n', 'The wings of these cherubim spread themselves out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, and their faces were towards the house. \n', 'He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim. \n', 'Also he made before the house two pillars thirty-five cubits heigh, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. \n', 'He made chains in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. \n', 'He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'Then he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. \n', 'Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference. \n', 'Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast. \n', 'It stood on twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, three looking towards the west, three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward. \n', 'It was a handbreadth thick. Its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths. \n', 'He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the burnt offering were washed in them, but the sea was for the priests to wash in. \n', 'He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. \n', 'He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold. \n', 'Furthermore he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze. \n', 'He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, towards the south. \n', 'Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Huram finished doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God’s house: \n', 'the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, \n', 'and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks—two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars. \n', 'He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases— \n', 'one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. \n', 'Huram-abi also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon, for the LORD’s house, of bright bronze. \n', 'The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. \n', 'Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, so that the weight of the bronze could not be determined. \n', 'Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house: the golden altar, the tables with the show bread on them, \n', 'and the lamp stands with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; \n', 'and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was purest gold; \n', 'and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'Thus all the work that Solomon did for the LORD’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of God’s house. \n', 'Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD’s covenant out of David’s city, which is Zion. \n', 'So all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month. \n', 'All the elders of Israel came. The Levites took up the ark. \n', 'They brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent. The Levitical priests brought these up. \n', 'King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled to him were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. \n', 'The priests brought in the ark of the LORD’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. \n', 'For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. \n', 'The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen outside; and it is there to this day. \n', 'There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. \n', 'When the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions; \n', 'also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets); \n', 'when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, “For he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever!” then the house was filled with a cloud, even the LORD’s house, \n', 'so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the LORD’s glory filled God’s house. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', 'Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. \n', 'But I have built you a house and home, a place for you to dwell in forever.” \n', 'The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel stood. \n', 'He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying, \n', '‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there, and I chose no man to be prince over my people Israel; \n', 'but now I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ \n', 'Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. \n', 'But the LORD said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart; \n', 'nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’ \n', '“The LORD has performed his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. \n', 'There I have set the ark, in which is the LORD’s covenant, which he made with the children of Israel.” \n', 'He stood before the LORD’s altar in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands \n', '(for Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court; and he stood on it, and knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands towards heaven). \n', 'Then he said, “LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth—you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart; \n', 'who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today. \n', '“Now therefore, LORD, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’ \n', 'Now therefore, LORD, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David. \n', '“But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house which I have built! \n', 'Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant and to his supplication, LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you; \n', 'that your eyes may be open towards this house day and night, even towards the place where you have said that you would put your name, to listen to the prayer which your servant will pray towards this place. \n', 'Listen to the petitions of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray towards this place. Yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive. \n', '“If a man sins against his neighbour, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house, \n', 'then hear from heaven, act, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. \n', '“If your people Israel are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house, \n', 'then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers. \n', '“When the sky is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray towards this place and confess your name, and turn from their sin when you afflict them, \n', 'then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance. \n', '“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is— \n', 'whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who will each know his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread out his hands towards this house, \n', 'then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men), \n', 'that they may fear you, to walk in your ways as long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers. \n', '“Moreover, concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for your great name’s sake and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when they come and pray towards this house, \n', 'then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name. \n', '“If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you send them, and they pray to you towards this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name; \n', 'then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. \n', '“If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near; \n', 'yet if they come to their senses in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;’ \n', 'if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray towards their land which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and towards the house which I have built for your name; \n', 'then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you. \n', '“Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place. \n', '“Now therefore arise, LORD God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength.

"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 7.\n', 'Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the LORD’s glory filled the house. \n', 'The priests could not enter into the LORD’s house, because the LORD’s glory filled the LORD’s house. \n', 'All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the LORD’s glory was on the house. They bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, worshipped, and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, “For he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever!” \n', 'Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. \n', 'King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God’s house. \n', 'The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to give thanks to the LORD, when David praised by their ministry, saying “For his loving kindness endures forever.” The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood. \n', 'Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court that was before the LORD’s house holy; for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat. \n', 'So Solomon held the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt. \n', 'On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. \n', 'On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David, to Solomon, and to Israel his people. \n', 'Thus Solomon finished the LORD’s house and the king’s house; and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the LORD’s house and in his own house. \n', 'Then the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself for a house of sacrifice. \n', '“If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence amongst my people, \n', 'if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. \n', 'Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayer that is made in this place. \n', 'For now I have chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart will be there perpetually. \n', '“As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances, \n', 'then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.’ \n', 'But if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, \n', 'then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword amongst all peoples. \n', 'This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, ‘Why has the LORD done this to this land and to this house?’ \n', 'They shall answer, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and took other gods, worshipped them, and served them. Therefore he has brought all this evil on them.’” \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 8.\n', 'At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the LORD’s house and his own house, \n', 'Solomon built the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. \n', 'Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it. \n', 'He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath. \n', 'Also he built Beth Horon the upper and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars; \n', 'and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. \n', 'As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel— \n', 'of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn’t consume—of them Solomon conscripted forced labour to this day. \n', 'But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work, but they were men of war, chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. \n', 'These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people. \n', 'Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter out of David’s city to the house that he had built for her; for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where the LORD’s ark has come are holy.” \n', 'Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the LORD’s altar which he had built before the porch, \n', 'even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times per year, during the feast of unleavened bread, during the feast of weeks, and during the feast of booths. \n', 'He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required, the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of God had so commanded. \n', 'They didn’t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures. \n', 'Now all the work of Solomon was accomplished from the day of the foundation of the LORD’s house until it was finished. So the LORD’s house was completed. \n', 'Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom. \n', 'Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 9.\n', 'When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great caravan, including camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. When she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart. \n', 'Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from Solomon which he didn’t tell her. \n', 'When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, \n', 'the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, their clothing, his cup bearers and their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to the LORD’s house, there was no more spirit in her. \n', 'She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom. \n', 'However I didn’t believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold half of the greatness of your wisdom wasn’t told me. You exceed the fame that I heard! \n', 'Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom. \n', 'Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you and set you on his throne to be king for the LORD your God, because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever. Therefore he made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.” \n', 'She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones. There was never before such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. \n', 'The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones. \n', 'The king used algum tree wood to make terraces for the LORD’s house and for the king’s house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers. There were none like these seen before in the land of Judah. \n', 'King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, more than that which she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants. \n', 'Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, \n', 'in addition to that which the traders and merchants brought. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. \n', 'King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold. Six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one large shield. \n', 'He made three hundred shields of beaten gold. Three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. \n', 'Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. \n', 'There were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests. \n', 'Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was nothing like it made in any other kingdom. \n', 'All king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. \n', 'For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Huram’s servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. \n', 'So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. \n', 'All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. \n', 'They each brought tribute: vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armour, spices, horses, and mules every year. \n', 'Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen that he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. \n', 'He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. \n', 'The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as abundant as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. \n', 'They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt and out of all lands. \n', 'Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? \n', 'Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. \n', 'Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in his father David’s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 10.\n', 'Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. \n', 'When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. \n', 'They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, \n', '“Your father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.” \n', 'He said to them, “Come again to me after three days.” So the people departed. \n', 'King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?” \n', 'They spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” \n', 'But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. \n', 'He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’” \n', 'The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. \n', 'Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’” \n', 'So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.” \n', 'The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men, \n', 'and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.” \n', 'So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that the LORD might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. \n', 'When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents. \n', 'But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. \n', 'Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labour; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. \n', 'So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 11.\n', 'When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. \n', 'But the LORD’s word came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, \n', '“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, \n', '‘The LORD says, “You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Every man return to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to the LORD’s words, and returned from going against Jeroboam. \n', 'Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. \n', 'He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, \n', 'Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, \n', 'Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, \n', 'Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, \n', 'Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. \n', 'He fortified the strongholds and put captains in them with stores of food, oil and wine. \n', 'He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceedingly strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him. \n', 'The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him out of all their territory. \n', 'For the Levites left their pasture lands and their possessions, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to the LORD. \n', 'He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goat and calf idols which he had made. \n', 'After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those who set their hearts to seek the LORD, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n', 'So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon. \n', 'Rehoboam took a wife for himself, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. \n', 'She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. \n', 'After her, he took Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. \n', 'Rehoboam loved Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. \n', 'Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince amongst his brothers, for he intended to make him king. \n', 'He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance; and he sought many wives for them. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 12.\n', 'When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the LORD’s law, and all Israel with him. \n', 'In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against the LORD, \n', 'with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. \n', 'He took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. \n', 'Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “The LORD says, ‘You have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.’” \n', 'Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “The LORD is righteous.” \n', 'When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the LORD’s word came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath won’t be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. \n', 'Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.” \n', 'So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the LORD’s house and the treasures of the king’s house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made. \n', 'King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. \n', 'As often as the king entered into the LORD’s house, the guard came and bore them, then brought them back into the guard room. \n', 'When he humbled himself, the LORD’s wrath turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether. Moreover, there were good things found in Judah. \n', 'So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. \n', 'He did that which was evil, because he didn’t set his heart to seek the LORD. \n', 'Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, in the genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. \n', 'Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city; and Abijah his son reigned in his place. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 13.\n', 'In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. \n', 'He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. \n', 'Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour. \n', 'Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel: \n', 'Ought you not to know that the LORD, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? \n', 'Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. \n', 'Worthless men were gathered to him, wicked fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them. \n', '“Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods are with you. \n', 'Haven’t you driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no gods. \n', '“But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests serving the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work. \n', 'They burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table, and care for the gold lamp stand with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we keep the instruction of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken him. \n', 'Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers; for you will not prosper.” \n', 'But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them. \n', 'When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. \n', 'Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. \n', 'The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand. \n', 'Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell down slain. \n', 'Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n', 'Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. \n', 'Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. The LORD struck him, and he died. \n', 'But Abijah grew mighty and took for himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. \n', 'The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 14.\n', 'So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days, the land was quiet ten years. \n', 'Asa did that which was good and right in the LORD his God’s eyes, \n', 'for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, \n', 'and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to obey his law and command. \n', 'Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him. \n', 'He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because the LORD had given him rest. \n', 'For he said to Judah, “Let’s build these cities and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered. \n', 'Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valour. \n', 'Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah. \n', 'Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. \n', 'Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, “LORD, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, LORD our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. LORD, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.” \n', 'So the LORD struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. \n', 'Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves, for they were destroyed before the LORD and before his army. Judah’s army carried away very much booty. \n', 'They struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD came on them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. \n', 'They also struck the tents of those who had livestock, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, then returned to Jerusalem. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 15.\n', 'The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded. \n', 'He went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! The LORD is with you while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. \n', 'Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law. \n', 'But when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them. \n', 'In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands. \n', 'They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity. \n', 'But you be strong! Don’t let your hands be slack, for your work will be rewarded.” \n', 'When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed the LORD’s altar that was before the LORD’s porch. \n', 'He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. \n', 'So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. \n', 'They sacrificed to the LORD in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep. \n', 'They entered into the covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul; \n', 'and that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. \n', 'They swore to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets. \n', 'All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. Then the LORD gave them rest all around. \n', 'Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. \n', 'But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. \n', 'He brought the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house. \n', 'There was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 16.\n', 'In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. \n', 'Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the LORD’s house and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying, \n', '“Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.” \n', 'Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. \n', 'When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease. \n', 'Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. \n', 'At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand. \n', 'Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and exceedingly many horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand. \n', 'For the LORD’s eyes run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.” \n', 'Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. \n', 'Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. \n', 'In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great; yet in his disease he didn’t seek the LORD, but just the physicians. \n', 'Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign. \n', 'They buried him in his own tomb, which he had dug out for himself in David’s city, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire for him. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 17.\n', 'Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. \n', 'He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. \n', 'The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals, \n', 'but sought the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel. \n', 'Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honour in abundance. \n', 'His heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD.

Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good.” \n', 'Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, I will say what my God says.” \n', 'When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand.” \n', 'The king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the LORD’s name?” \n', 'He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The LORD said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’” \n', 'The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” \n', 'Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the LORD’s word: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. \n', 'The LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way. \n', 'A spirit came out, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ “The LORD said to him, ‘How?’ \n', '“He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ “He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.’ \n', '“Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you.” \n', 'Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the LORD’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?” \n', 'Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.” \n', 'The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; \n', 'and say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’” \n', 'Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, you people, all of you!” \n', 'So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. \n', 'The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle. \n', 'Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.” \n', 'When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against him.

"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 20.\n', 'After this, the children of Moab, the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. \n', 'Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria. Behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi). \n', 'Jehoshaphat was alarmed, and set himself to seek to the LORD.

Aren’t you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in your hand, so that no one is able to withstand you. \n', 'Didn’t you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the offspring of Abraham your friend forever? \n', 'They lived in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying, \n', '‘If evil comes on us—the sword, judgement, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’ \n', 'Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned away from them, and didn’t destroy them; \n', 'behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit. \n', 'Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. We don’t know what to do, but our eyes are on you.” \n', 'All Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. \n', 'Then the LORD’s Spirit came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, in the middle of the assembly; \n', 'and he said, “Listen, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, king Jehoshaphat. The LORD says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. \n', 'Tomorrow, go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. \n', 'You will not need to fight this battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Go out against them tomorrow, for the LORD is with you.’” \n', 'Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshipping the LORD. \n', 'The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice. \n', 'They rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the LORD your God, so you will be established! Believe his prophets, so you will prosper.” \n', 'When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the LORD and give praise in holy array as they go out before the army, and say, “Give thanks to the LORD, for his loving kindness endures forever.” \n', 'When they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck. \n', 'For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. When they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy each other. \n', 'When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped. \n', 'When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found amongst them in abundance both riches and dead bodies with precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They took plunder for three days, it was so much. \n', 'On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Beracah Valley, for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore the name of that place was called “Beracah Valley” to this day. \n', 'Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. \n', 'They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to the LORD’s house. \n', 'The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. \n', 'So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around. \n', 'So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. He reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem.

The same did very wickedly. \n', 'He joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber. \n', 'Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” The ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish. \n']"

He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots. \n', 'So Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers. \n', 'Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem play the prostitute, and led Judah astray. \n', 'A letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “the LORD, the God of David your father, says, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, \n', 'but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute like Ahab’s house did, and also have slain your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself, \n', 'behold, the LORD will strike your people with a great plague, including your children, your wives, and all your possessions; \n', 'and you will have great sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’” \n', 'The LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians; \n', 'and they came up against Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, including his sons and his wives, so that there was no son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. \n', 'After all this the LORD struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease. \n', 'In process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. \n', 'He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.

See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t do it right away. \n', 'The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why haven’t you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the assembly of Israel, out of Judah and out of Jerusalem, for the Tent of the Testimony?” \n', 'For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the LORD’s house to the Baals. \n', 'So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the LORD’s house. \n', 'They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness. \n', 'All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had filled it. \n', 'Whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. \n', 'The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the LORD’s house. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD’s house, and also those who worked iron and bronze to repair the LORD’s house. \n', 'So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands. They set up God’s house as it was designed, and strengthened it. \n', 'When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for the LORD’s house, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, including spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the LORD’s house continually all the days of Jehoiada. \n', 'But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was one hundred and thirty years old when he died. \n', 'They buried him in David’s city amongst the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and towards God and his house. \n', 'Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. \n', 'They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols, so wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness. \n', 'Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again to the LORD, and they testified against them; but they would not listen. \n', 'The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, “God says, ‘Why do you disobey the LORD’s commandments, so that you can’t prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.’” \n', 'They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the LORD’s house. \n', 'Thus Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son.

Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to give direction; and others of the Levites, who were all skilful with musical instruments. \n', 'Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers. \n', 'When they brought out the money that was brought into the LORD’s house, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the LORD’s law given by Moses. \n', 'Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the LORD’s house.” So Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. \n', 'Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, “All that was committed to your servants, they are doing. \n', 'They have emptied out the money that was found in the LORD’s house, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and into the hand of the workmen.” \n', 'Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan read from it to the king. \n', 'When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes. \n', 'The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, \n', '“Go enquire of the LORD for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the LORD’s wrath that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the LORD’s word, to do according to all that is written in this book.” \n', 'So Hilkiah and those whom the king had commanded went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect. \n', 'She said to them, “The LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me, \n', '“The LORD says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah. \n', 'Because they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’”’ \n', 'But to the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, you shall tell him this, ‘The LORD, the God of Israel says: “About the words which you have heard, \n', 'because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you,” says the LORD. \n', '“Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes won’t see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.”’” They brought back this message to the king. \n', 'Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. \n', 'The king went up to the LORD’s house with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests, the Levites, and all the people, both great and small—and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the LORD’s house. \n', 'The king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. \n', 'He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. \n', 'Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. All his days they didn’t depart from following the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 35.\n', 'Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem. They killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. \n', 'He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of the LORD’s house. \n', 'He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. It will no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel. \n', 'Prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. \n', 'Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites. \n', 'Kill the Passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the LORD’s word by Moses.” \n', 'Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls. These were of the king’s substance. \n', 'His princes gave a free will offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle. \n', 'Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle. \n', 'So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment. \n', 'They killed the Passover lambs, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from their hands, and the Levites skinned them. \n', 'They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle. \n', 'They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. \n', 'Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron. \n', 'The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate. They didn’t need to depart from their service, because their brothers the Levites prepared for them. \n', 'So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the LORD’s altar, according to the commandment of king Josiah. \n', 'The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. \n', 'There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept—with the priests, the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. \n', 'This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah. \n', 'After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him. \n', 'But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you today, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he not destroy you.” \n', 'Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. \n', 'The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!” \n', 'So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. \n', 'Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel. Behold, they are written in the lamentations. \n', 'Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the LORD’s law, \n', 'and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. \n']"
"['\ufeff2 Chronicles.\n', 'Chapter 36.\n', 'Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem. \n', 'Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. \n', 'The king of Egypt removed him from office at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. \n', 'The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. \n', 'Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the LORD his God’s sight. \n', 'Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon. \n', 'Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of the LORD’s house to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. \n', 'Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. \n', 'Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight. \n', 'At the return of the year, king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the valuable vessels of the LORD’s house, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. \n', 'Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. \n', 'He did that which was evil in the LORD his God’s sight. He didn’t humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the LORD’s mouth. \n', 'He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel. \n', 'Moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the LORD’s house which he had made holy in Jerusalem. \n', 'The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place; \n', 'but they mocked the messengers of God, despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the LORD’s wrath arose against his people, until there was no remedy. \n', 'Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm. He gave them all into his hand. \n', 'All the vessels of God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of the LORD’s house, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon. \n', 'They burnt God’s house, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all of its valuable vessels. \n', 'He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon, and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia, \n', 'to fulfil the LORD’s word by Jeremiah’s mouth, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as it lay desolate, it kept Sabbath, to fulfil seventy years. \n', 'Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the LORD’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, \n', '“Cyrus king of Persia says, ‘The LORD, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is amongst you of all his people, the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.’” \n']"
