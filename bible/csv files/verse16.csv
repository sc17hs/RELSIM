"['\ufeffThe Book of Nehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the palace, \n', 'Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. \n', 'They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burnt with fire.” \n', 'When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, \n', 'and said, “I beg you, LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments, \n', 'let your ear now be attentive and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned. \n', 'We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses. \n', '“Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you amongst the peoples; \n', 'but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’ \n', '“Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. \n', 'Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” Now I was cup bearer to the king. \n']"
"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence. \n', 'The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.” Then I was very much afraid. \n', 'I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?” \n', 'Then the king said to me, “What is your request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. \n', 'I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favour in your sight, I ask that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build it.” \n', 'The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), “How long will your journey be? When will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him. \n', 'Moreover I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah; \n', 'and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.” The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me. \n', 'Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. \n', 'When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. \n', 'So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. \n', 'I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn’t any animal with me except the animal that I rode on. \n', 'I went out by night by the valley gate towards the jackal’s well, then to the dung gate; and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire. \n', 'Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king’s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass. \n', 'Then I went up in the night by the brook and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. \n', 'The rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work. \n', 'Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burnt with fire. Come, let’s build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.” \n', 'I told them about the hand of my God which was good on me, and also about the king’s words that he had spoken to me. They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work. \n', 'But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?” \n', 'Then I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.” \n']"
"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate. They sanctified it, and set up its doors.

He built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. \n', 'Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired the spring gate. He built it, covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars; and he repaired the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even to the stairs that go down from David’s city. \n', 'After him, Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur, made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty men. \n', 'After him, the Levites—Rehum the son of Bani made repairs.

"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'But when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and was very indignant, and mocked the Jews. \n', 'He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burnt?” \n', 'Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.” \n', '“Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn back their reproach on their own head. Give them up for a plunder in a land of captivity. \n', 'Don’t cover their iniquity. Don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders.” \n', 'So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work. \n', 'But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, they were very angry; \n', 'and they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion amongst us. \n', 'But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night because of them. \n', 'Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading and there is much rubble, so that we are not able to build the wall.” \n', 'Our adversaries said, “They will not know or see, until we come in amongst them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.” \n', 'When the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.” \n', 'Therefore I set guards in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places. I set the people by family groups with their swords, their spears, and their bows. \n', 'I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.” \n', 'When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. \n', 'From that time forth, half of my servants did the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. \n', 'Those who built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands did the work, and with the other held his weapon. \n', 'Amongst the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me. \n', 'I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread out, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. \n', 'Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.” \n', 'So we did the work. Half of the people held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared. \n', 'Likewise at the same time I said to the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day.” \n', 'So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water. \n']"
"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews. \n', 'For there were some who said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.” \n', 'There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.” \n', 'There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral. \n', 'Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring our sons and our daughters into bondage to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. It is also not in our power to help it, because other men have our fields and our vineyards.” \n', 'I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. \n', 'Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them. \n', 'I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to say. \n', 'Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? \n', 'I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury. \n', 'Please restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.” \n', 'Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them. We will do so, even as you say.” Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise. \n', 'Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that doesn’t perform this promise; even may he be shaken out and emptied like this.” All the assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the LORD. The people did according to this promise. \n', 'Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor. \n', 'But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, plus forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people, but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God. \n', 'Yes, I also continued in the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land. All my servants were gathered there to the work. \n', 'Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred and fifty men, in addition to those who came to us from amongst the nations that were around us. \n', 'Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage was heavy on this people. \n', 'Remember me, my God, for all the good that I have done for this people. \n']"
"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', 'Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), \n', 'Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come! Let’s meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me. \n', 'I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?” \n', 'They sent to me four times like this; and I answered them the same way. \n', 'Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, \n', 'in which was written, “It is reported amongst the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words. \n', 'You have also appointed prophets to proclaim of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let’s take counsel together.” \n', 'Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart.” \n', 'For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands. \n', 'I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, “Let us meet together in God’s house, within the temple, and let’s shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you. Yes, in the night they will come to kill you.” \n', 'I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.” \n', 'I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him, but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. \n', 'He was hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me. \n', '“Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.” \n', 'So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days. \n', 'When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations that were around us were afraid, and they lost their confidence; for they perceived that this work was done by our God. \n', 'Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them. \n', 'For there were many in Judah sworn to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife. \n', 'Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. \n']"
"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 7.\n', 'Now when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed, \n', 'I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man and feared God above many. \n', 'I said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them; and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house.” \n', 'Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built. \n', 'My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be listed by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found this written in it: \n', 'These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city, \n', 'who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.

"['\ufeffNehemiah.\n', 'Chapter 8.\n', 'All the people gathered themselves together as one man into the wide place that was in front of the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel. \n', 'Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. \n', 'He read from it before the wide place that was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand. The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. \n', 'Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. \n', 'Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up. \n', 'Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. All the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” with the lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground. \n', 'Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law; and the people stayed in their place. \n', 'They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading. \n', 'Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “Today is holy to the LORD your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. \n', 'Then he said to them, “Go your way.
