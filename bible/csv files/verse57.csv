"['\ufeffThe Good News According to Luke.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled amongst us, \n', 'even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us, \n', 'it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; \n', 'that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed. \n', 'There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. \n', 'They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. \n', 'But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. \n', 'Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division \n', 'according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. \n', 'The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. \n', 'An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. \n', 'Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. \n', 'But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. \n', 'You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. \n', 'For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. \n', 'He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. \n', 'He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.” \n', 'Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.” \n', 'The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. \n', 'Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.” \n', 'The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled that he delayed in the temple. \n', 'When he came out, he could not speak to them. They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. \n', 'When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. \n', 'After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, \n', '“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach amongst men.” \n', 'Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, \n', 'to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. \n', 'Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favoured one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst women!” \n', 'But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. \n', 'The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. \n', 'Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ \n', 'He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, \n', 'and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.” \n', 'Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?” \n', 'The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. \n', 'Behold, Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. \n', 'For nothing spoken by God is impossible.” \n', 'Mary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her. \n', 'Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, \n', 'and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. \n', 'When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leapt in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. \n', 'She called out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! \n', 'Why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? \n', 'For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leapt in my womb for joy! \n', 'Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!” \n', 'Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord. \n', 'My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour, \n', 'for he has looked at the humble state of his servant. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed. \n', 'For he who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name. \n', 'His mercy is for generations and generations on those who fear him. \n', 'He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. \n', 'He has put down princes from their thrones, and has exalted the lowly. \n', 'He has filled the hungry with good things. He has sent the rich away empty. \n', 'He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy, \n', 'as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever.” \n', 'Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house. \n', 'Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son. \n', 'Her neighbours and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her. \n', 'On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. \n', 'His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.” \n', 'They said to her, “There is no one amongst your relatives who is called by this name.” \n', 'They made signs to his father, what he would have him called. \n', 'He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.” They all marvelled. \n', 'His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. \n', 'Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea. \n', 'All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him. \n', 'His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, \n', '“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people; \n', 'and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David \n', '(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old), \n', 'salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us; \n', 'to show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant, \n', 'the oath which he swore to Abraham our father, \n', 'to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear, \n', 'in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life. \n', 'And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, \n', 'to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, \n', 'because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the dawn from on high will visit us, \n', 'to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace.” \n', 'The child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel. \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. \n', 'This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. \n', 'All went to enrol themselves, everyone to his own city. \n', 'Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, \n', 'to enrol himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant. \n', 'While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. \n', 'She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. \n', 'There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. \n', 'Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. \n', 'The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people. \n', 'For there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. \n', 'This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.” \n', 'Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God and saying, \n', '“Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will towards men.” \n', 'When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” \n', 'They came with haste and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough. \n', 'When they saw it, they publicised widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child. \n', 'All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. \n', 'But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. \n', 'The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them. \n', 'When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. \n', 'When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord \n', '(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”), \n', 'and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.” \n', 'Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. \n', 'It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. \n', 'He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law, \n', 'then he received him into his arms and blessed God, and said, \n', '“Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace; \n', 'for my eyes have seen your salvation, \n', 'which you have prepared before the face of all peoples; \n', 'a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.” \n', 'Joseph and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him. \n', 'Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. \n', 'Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.” \n', 'There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, \n', 'and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day. \n', 'Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem. \n', 'When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. \n', 'The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. \n', 'His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover. \n', 'When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast; \n', 'and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, \n', 'but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they looked for him amongst their relatives and acquaintances. \n', 'When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. \n', 'After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. \n', 'All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. \n', 'When they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.” \n', 'He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?” \n', 'They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them. \n', 'And he went down with them and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. \n', 'And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men. \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, \n', 'during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. \n', 'He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins. \n', 'As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight. \n', 'Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth. \n', 'All flesh will see God’s salvation.’” \n', 'He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptised by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? \n', 'Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say amongst yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones! \n', 'Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” \n', 'The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?” \n', 'He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.” \n', 'Tax collectors also came to be baptised, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?” \n', 'He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.” \n', 'Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?” He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.” \n', 'As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, \n', 'John answered them all, “I indeed baptise you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptise you in the Holy Spirit and fire. \n', 'His winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” \n', 'Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people, \n', 'but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, \n', 'added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison. \n', 'Now when all the people were baptised, Jesus also had been baptised and was praying. The sky was opened, \n', 'and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.” \n', 'Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, \n', 'the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, \n', 'the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, \n', 'the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah, \n', 'the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, \n', 'the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er, \n', 'the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, \n', 'the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim, \n', 'the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, \n', 'the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, \n', 'the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, \n', 'the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, \n', 'the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, \n', 'the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, \n', 'the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, \n', 'the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness \n', 'for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry. \n', 'The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” \n', 'Jesus answered him, saying, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’” \n', 'The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. \n', 'The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I want. \n', 'If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.” \n', 'Jesus answered him, “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’” \n', 'He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here, \n', 'for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’ \n', 'and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’” \n', 'Jesus answering, said to him, “It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’” \n', 'When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time. \n', 'Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area. \n', 'He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. \n', 'He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. \n', 'The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written, \n', '“The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed, \n', 'and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” \n', 'He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. \n', 'He began to tell them, “Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” \n', 'All testified about him and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” \n', 'He said to them, “Doubtless you will tell me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.’” \n', 'He said, “Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. \n', 'But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land. \n', 'Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. \n', 'There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.” \n', 'They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things. \n', 'They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff. \n', 'But he, passing through the middle of them, went his way. \n', 'He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day, \n', 'and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. \n', 'In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, \n', 'saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!” \n', 'Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm. \n', 'Amazement came on all and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” \n', 'News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region. \n', 'He rose up from the synagogue and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him to help her. \n', 'He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. \n', 'When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. \n', 'Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. \n', 'When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them. \n', 'But he said to them, “I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.” \n', 'He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. \n', 'He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. \n', 'He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. \n', 'When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” \n', 'Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.” \n', 'When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. \n', 'They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. \n', 'But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.” \n', 'For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; \n', 'and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.” \n', 'When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. \n', 'While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” \n', 'He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him. \n', 'He commanded him to tell no one, “But go your way and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.” \n', 'But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. \n', 'But he withdrew himself into the desert and prayed. \n', 'On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. \n', 'Behold, men brought a paralysed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. \n', 'Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus. \n', 'Seeing their faith, he said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.” \n', 'The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?” \n', 'But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, “Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? \n', 'Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’ \n', 'But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralysed man, “I tell you, arise, take up your cot, and go to your house.” \n', 'Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. \n', 'Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.” \n', 'After these things he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, “Follow me!” \n', 'He left everything, and rose up and followed him. \n', 'Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. \n', 'Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?” \n', 'Jesus answered them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. \n', 'I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” \n', 'They said to him, “Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?” \n', 'He said to them, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? \n', 'But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.” \n', 'He also told a parable to them. “No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. \n', 'No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed. \n', 'But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved. \n', 'No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’” \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', 'Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. \n', 'But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?” \n', 'Jesus, answering them, said, “Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him, \n', 'how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?” \n', 'He said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” \n', 'It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered. \n', 'The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. \n', 'But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Rise up and stand in the middle.” He arose and stood. \n', 'Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” \n', 'He looked around at them all, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. \n', 'But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus. \n', 'In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. \n', 'When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles: \n', 'Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; \n', 'Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot; \n', 'Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor. \n', 'He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, \n', 'as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits; and they were being healed. \n', 'All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all. \n', 'He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for God’s Kingdom is yours. \n', 'Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. \n', 'Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake. \n', 'Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets. \n', '“But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation. \n', 'Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. \n', 'Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets. \n', '“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, \n', 'bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you. \n', 'To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also. \n', 'Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again. \n', '“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them. \n', '“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. \n', 'If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. \n', 'If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much. \n', 'But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind towards the unthankful and evil. \n', '“Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is also merciful. \n', 'Don’t judge, and you won’t be judged. Don’t condemn, and you won’t be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free. \n', '“Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.” \n', 'He spoke a parable to them. “Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit? \n', 'A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. \n', 'Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye? \n', 'Or how can you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye. \n', '“For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree that produces good fruit. \n', 'For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush. \n', 'The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks. \n', '“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say? \n', 'Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words and does them, I will show you who he is like. \n', 'He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock. \n', 'But he who hears and doesn’t do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.” \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 7.\n', 'After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. \n', 'A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. \n', 'When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant. \n', 'When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, \n', 'for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.” \n', 'Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. \n', 'Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed. \n', 'For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” \n', 'When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.” \n', 'Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well. \n', 'Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him. \n', 'Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only born son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her. \n', 'When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, “Don’t cry.” \n', 'He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I tell you, arise!” \n', 'He who was dead sat up and began to speak. Then he gave him to his mother. \n', 'Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen amongst us!” and, “God has visited his people!” \n', 'This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region. \n', 'The disciples of John told him about all these things. \n', 'John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?” \n', 'When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptiser has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’” \n', 'In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight. \n', 'Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. \n', 'Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.” \n', 'When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? \n', 'But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed and live delicately are in kings’ courts. \n', 'But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. \n', 'This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ \n', '“For I tell you, amongst those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptiser; yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.” \n', 'When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptised with John’s baptism. \n', 'But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptised by him themselves. \n', '“To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? \n', 'They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’ \n', 'For John the Baptiser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ \n', 'The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ \n', 'Wisdom is justified by all her children.” \n', 'One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the table. \n', 'Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. \n', 'Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. \n', 'Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.” \n', 'Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” He said, “Teacher, say on.” \n', '“A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. \n', 'When they couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?” \n', 'Simon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.” He said to him, “You have judged correctly.” \n', 'Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. \n', 'You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. \n', 'You didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. \n', 'Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.” \n', 'He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” \n', 'Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” \n', 'He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 8.\n', 'Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve, \n', 'and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; \n', 'and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others who served them from their possessions. \n', 'When a great multitude came together and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable: \n', '“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it. \n', 'Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. \n', 'Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it. \n', 'Other fell into the good ground and grew and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!” \n', 'Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?” \n', 'He said, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest it is given in parables, that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’ \n', '“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. \n', 'Those along the road are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. \n', 'Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. \n', 'What fell amongst the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life; and they bring no fruit to maturity. \n', 'Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance. \n', '“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light. \n', 'For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light. \n', 'Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.” \n', 'His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd. \n', 'Some people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.” \n', 'But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.” \n', 'Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out. \n', 'But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. \n', 'They came to him and awoke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are dying!” He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; then they ceased, and it was calm. \n', 'He said to them, “Where is your faith?” Being afraid, they marvelled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?” \n', 'Then they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. \n', 'When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs. \n', 'When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!” \n', 'For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. \n', 'Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him. \n', 'They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. \n', 'Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. Then he allowed them. \n', 'The demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. \n', 'When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. \n', 'People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. \n', 'Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed. \n', 'All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. Then he entered into the boat and returned. \n', 'But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, \n', '“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. \n', 'When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. \n', 'Behold, a man named Jairus came. He was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged him to come into his house, \n', 'for he had an only born daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him. \n', 'A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any, \n', 'came behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. Immediately the flow of her blood stopped. \n', 'Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’” \n', 'But Jesus said, “Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.” \n', 'When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. \n', 'He said to her, “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” \n', 'While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.” \n', 'But Jesus hearing it, answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.” \n', 'When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother. \n', 'All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.” \n', 'They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead. \n', 'But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise!” \n', 'Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. \n', 'Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done. \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 9.\n', 'He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. \n', 'He sent them out to preach God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick. \n', 'He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey—no staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money. Don’t have two tunics each. \n', 'Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there. \n', 'As many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.” \n', 'They departed and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News and healing everywhere. \n', 'Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, \n', 'and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. \n', 'Herod said, “I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him. \n', 'The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. He took them and withdrew apart to a desert region of a city called Bethsaida. \n', 'But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing. \n', 'The day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms and lodge and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.” \n', 'But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.” \n', 'For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” \n', 'They did so, and made them all sit down. \n', 'He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. \n', 'They ate and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over. \n', 'As he was praying alone, the disciples were near him, and he asked them, “Who do the multitudes say that I am?” \n', 'They answered, “‘John the Baptiser,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again.” \n', 'He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” \n', 'But he warned them and commanded them to tell this to no one, \n', 'saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.” \n', 'He said to all, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. \n', 'For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake will save it. \n', 'For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self? \n', 'For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels. \n', 'But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here who will in no way taste of death until they see God’s Kingdom.” \n', 'About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. \n', 'As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. \n', 'Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, \n', 'who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. \n', 'Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. \n', 'As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said. \n', 'While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. \n', 'A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” \n', 'When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen. \n', 'On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. \n', 'Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only born child. \n', 'Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams; and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. \n', 'I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.” \n', 'Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.” \n', 'While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. \n', 'They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples, \n', '“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.” \n', 'But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. \n', 'An argument arose amongst them about which of them was the greatest. \n', 'Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, \n', 'and said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least amongst you all, this one will be great.” \n', 'John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.” \n', 'It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem \n', 'and sent messengers before his face. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. \n', 'They didn’t receive him, because he was travelling with his face set towards Jerusalem. \n', 'When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?” \n', 'But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are. \n', 'For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” They went to another village. \n', 'As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” \n', 'He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” \n', 'But Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.” \n', 'Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.” \n', 'But Jesus said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.” \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 10.\n', 'Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place where he was about to come. \n', 'Then he said to them, “The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the labourers are few.

Nothing will in any way hurt you. \n', 'Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” \n', 'In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.” \n', 'Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father.

Do this, and you will live.” \n', 'But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbour?” \n', 'Jesus answered, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell amongst robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. \n', 'By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. \n', 'In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. \n', 'But a certain Samaritan, as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, \n', 'came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. \n', 'On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’ \n', 'Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbour to him who fell amongst the robbers?” \n', 'He said, “He who showed mercy on him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.” \n', 'As they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. \n', 'She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard his word. \n', 'But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone?

You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.” \n', 'He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!” \n', 'He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.” \n', 'He said to them, “When I sent you out without purse, bag, and sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.” \n', 'Then he said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. \n', 'For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’ For that which concerns me is being fulfilled.” \n', 'They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” He said to them, “That is enough.” \n', 'He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. \n', 'When he was at the place, he said to them, “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.” \n', 'He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, \n', 'saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” \n', 'An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. \n', 'Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. \n', 'When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, \n', 'and said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.” \n', 'While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared. He who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. \n', 'But Jesus said to him, “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?” \n', 'When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” \n', 'A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. \n', 'But Jesus answered, “Let me at least do this”—and he touched his ear and healed him. \n', 'Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? \n', 'When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” \n', 'They seized him and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance. \n', 'When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat amongst them. \n', 'A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.” \n', 'He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” \n', 'After a little while someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!” \n', 'After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” \n', 'But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. \n', 'The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.” \n', 'He went out, and wept bitterly. \n', 'The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him. \n', 'Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” \n', 'They spoke many other things against him, insulting him. \n', 'As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying, \n', '“If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t believe, \n', 'and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. \n', 'From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” \n', 'They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say it, because I am.” \n', 'They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!” \n']"
"['\ufeffLuke.\n', 'Chapter 23.\n', 'The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. \n', 'They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” \n', 'Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered him, “So you say.” \n', 'Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” \n', 'But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.” \n', 'But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. \n', 'When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. \n', 'Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. \n', 'He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. \n', 'The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. \n', 'Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. \n', 'Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. \n', 'Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, \n', 'and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. \n', 'Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. \n', 'I will therefore chastise him and release him.” \n', 'Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast. \n', 'But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”— \n', 'one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. \n', 'Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus, \n', 'but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” \n', 'He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” \n', 'But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. \n', 'Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. \n', 'He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will. \n', 'When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus. \n', 'A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. \n', 'But Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. \n', 'For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ \n', 'Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’ \n', 'For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?” \n', 'There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. \n', 'When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. \n', 'Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments amongst them, they cast lots. \n', 'The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!” \n', 'The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, \n', 'and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” \n', 'An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” \n', 'One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!” \n', 'But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? \n', 'And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” \n', 'He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” \n', 'It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. \n', 'The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. \n', 'Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last. \n', 'When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.” \n', 'All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts. \n', 'All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things. \n', 'Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man \n', '(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom. \n', 'This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. \n', 'He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. \n', 'It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. \n', 'The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. \n', 'They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. \n']"
