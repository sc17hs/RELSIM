"['\ufeffThe Second Book of Mosis, Commonly Called Exodus.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): \n', 'Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, \n', 'Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, \n', 'Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. \n', 'All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. \n', 'Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation. \n', 'The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them. \n', 'Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph. \n', 'He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. \n', 'Come, let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out of the land.” \n', 'Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. \n', 'But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel. \n', 'The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve, \n', 'and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve. \n', 'The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah, \n', 'and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.” \n', 'But the midwives feared God, and didn’t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive. \n', 'The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?” \n', 'The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigourous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” \n', 'God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty. \n', 'Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. \n', 'Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.” \n']"
"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife. \n', 'The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. \n', 'When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank. \n', 'His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. \n', 'Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket amongst the reeds, and sent her servant to get it. \n', 'She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” \n', 'Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” \n', 'Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” The young woman went and called the child’s mother. \n', 'Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” The woman took the child, and nursed it. \n', 'The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.” \n', 'In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. \n', 'He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. \n', 'He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?” \n', 'He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.” \n', 'Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. \n', 'Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. \n', 'The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. \n', 'When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?” \n', 'They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.” \n', 'He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” \n', 'Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. \n', 'She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.” \n', 'In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. \n', 'God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. \n', 'God saw the children of Israel, and God understood. \n']"
"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb. \n', 'The LORD’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burnt with fire, and the bush was not consumed. \n', 'Moses said, “I will go now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.” \n', 'When the LORD saw that he came over to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses! Moses!” He said, “Here I am.” \n', 'He said, “Don’t come close. Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.” \n', 'Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. \n', 'The LORD said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. \n', 'I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. \n', 'Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. \n', 'Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” \n', 'Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” \n', 'He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.” \n', 'Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?” \n', 'God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” \n', 'God said moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations. \n', 'Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. \n', 'I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’ \n', 'They will listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD, our God.’ \n', 'I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand. \n', 'I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do amongst them, and after that he will let you go. \n', 'I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed. \n', 'But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing. You shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.” \n']"
"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'Moses answered, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’” \n', 'The LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.” \n', 'He said, “Throw it on the ground.” He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it. \n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.” He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand. \n', '“This is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.” \n', 'The LORD said furthermore to him, “Now put your hand inside your cloak.” He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. \n', 'He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.” He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh. \n', '“It will happen, if they will not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. \n', 'It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.” \n', 'Moses said to the LORD, “O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.” \n', 'The LORD said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, the LORD? \n', 'Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.” \n', 'Moses said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.” \n', 'The LORD’s anger burnt against Moses, and he said, “What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he is coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. \n', 'You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. \n', 'He will be your spokesman to the people. It will happen that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God. \n', 'You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.” \n', 'Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” \n', 'The LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.” \n', 'Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God’s rod in his hand. \n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. \n', 'You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘The LORD says, Israel is my son, my firstborn, \n', 'and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may serve me;” and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’” \n', 'On the way at a lodging place, the LORD met Moses and wanted to kill him. \n', 'Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” \n', 'So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision. \n', 'The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him. \n', 'Moses told Aaron all the LORD’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him. \n', 'Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. \n', 'Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. \n', 'The people believed, and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. \n']"
"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’” \n', 'Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.” \n', 'They said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.” \n', 'The king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!” \n', 'Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.” \n', 'The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying, \n', '“You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. \n', 'You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to our God.’ \n', 'Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labour in it. Don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.” \n', 'The taskmasters of the people went out with their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw. \n', 'Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’” \n', 'So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. \n', 'The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfil your work quota daily, as when there was straw!” \n', 'The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?” \n', 'Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants? \n', 'No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.” \n', 'But Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ \n', 'Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!” \n', 'The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!” \n', 'They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh. \n', 'They said to them, “May the LORD look at you and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!” \n', 'Moses returned to the LORD, and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me? \n', 'For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!” \n']"
"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.” \n', 'God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am the LORD. \n', 'I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name the LORD I was not known to them. \n', 'I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens. \n', 'Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. \n', 'Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgements. \n', 'I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. \n', 'I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD.’” \n', 'Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. \n', 'The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, \n', '“Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.” \n', 'Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel haven’t listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, when I have uncircumcised lips?” \n', 'The LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. \n', 'These are the heads of their fathers’ houses.

Who are we, that you murmur against us?” \n', 'Moses said, “Now the LORD will give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you, because the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.” \n', 'Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come close to the LORD, for he has heard your murmurings.’” \n', 'As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the LORD’s glory appeared in the cloud. \n', 'The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, \n', '“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’” \n', 'In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp. \n', 'When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground. \n', 'When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat. \n', 'This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.’” \n', 'The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less. \n', 'When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating. \n', 'Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.” \n', 'Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them. \n', 'They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted. \n', 'On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. \n', 'He said to them, “This is that which the LORD has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’” \n', 'They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it. \n', 'Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you shall not find it in the field. \n', 'Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.” \n', 'On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. \n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? \n', 'Behold, because the LORD has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.” \n', 'So the people rested on the seventh day. \n', 'The house of Israel called its name “Manna”, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey. \n', 'Moses said, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” \n', 'Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations.” \n', 'As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. \n', 'The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land.

"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 17.\n', 'All the congregation of the children of Israel travelled from the wilderness of Sin, starting according to the LORD’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink. \n', 'Therefore the people quarrelled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” \n', 'The people were thirsty for water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?” \n', 'Moses cried to the LORD, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.” \n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go. \n', 'Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. \n', 'He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarrelled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD amongst us, or not?” \n', 'Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. \n', 'Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God’s rod in my hand.” \n', 'So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. \n', 'When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. \n', 'But Moses’ hands were heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset. \n', 'Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. \n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.” \n', 'Moses built an altar, and called its name “The LORD our Banner”. \n', 'He said, “The LORD has sworn: ‘The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’” \n']"
"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 18.\n', 'Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. \n', 'Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away, \n', 'and her two sons.

Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God. \n', 'On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening. \n', 'When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?” \n', 'Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to enquire of God. \n', 'When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.” \n', 'Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good. \n', 'You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone. \n', 'Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you.

"['\ufeffExodus.\n', 'Chapter 32.\n', 'When the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.” \n', 'Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.” \n', 'All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. \n', 'He received what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a moulded calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” \n', 'When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.” \n', 'They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. \n', 'The LORD spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves! \n', 'They have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a moulded calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’” \n', 'The LORD said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. \n', 'Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.” \n', 'Moses begged the LORD his God, and said, “The LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? \n', 'Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people. \n', 'Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’” \n', 'So The LORD turned away from the evil which he said he would do to his people. \n', 'Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides. They were written on one side and on the other. \n', 'The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. \n', 'When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.” \n', 'He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory.

About three thousand men fell of the people that day. \n', 'Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, for every man was against his son and against his brother, that he may give you a blessing today.” \n', 'On the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin.
