"['\ufeffThe Good News According to Matthew.\n', 'Chapter 1.\n', 'The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \n', 'Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. \n', 'Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. \n', 'Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. \n', 'Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. \n', 'Jesse became the father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s wife. \n', 'Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. \n', 'Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. \n', 'Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah. \n', 'Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. \n', 'Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. \n', 'After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel. \n', 'Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. \n', 'Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud. \n', 'Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob. \n', 'Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. \n', 'So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. \n', 'Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. \n', 'Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. \n', 'But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. \n', 'She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.” \n', 'Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, \n', '“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son. They shall call his name Immanuel,” which is, being interpreted, “God with us.” \n', 'Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; \n', 'and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 2.\n', 'Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, \n', '“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” \n', 'When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. \n', 'Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. \n', 'They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, \n', '‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least amongst the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come a governor who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’” \n', 'Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learnt from them exactly what time the star appeared. \n', 'He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.” \n', 'They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was. \n', 'When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. \n', 'They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. \n', 'Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. \n', 'Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.” \n', 'He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, \n', 'and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.” \n', 'Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learnt from the wise men. \n', 'Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, \n', '“A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; she wouldn’t be comforted, because they are no more.” \n', 'But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, \n', '“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.” \n', 'He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. \n', 'But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, \n', 'and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he will be called a Nazarene. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 3.\n', 'In those days, John the Baptiser came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, \n', '“Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!” \n', 'For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make the way of the Lord ready! Make his paths straight!” \n', 'Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. \n', 'Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. \n', 'They were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. \n', 'But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? \n', 'Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! \n', 'Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. \n', 'Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. \n', '“I indeed baptise you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptise you in the Holy Spirit. \n', 'His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.” \n', 'Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised by him. \n', 'But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptised by you, and you come to me?” \n', 'But Jesus, answering, said to him, “Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfil all righteousness.” Then he allowed him. \n', 'Jesus, when he was baptised, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. \n', 'Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 4.\n', 'Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. \n', 'When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. \n', 'The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” \n', 'But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of God’s mouth.’” \n', 'Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, \n', 'and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’” \n', 'Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. \n', 'He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.” \n', 'Then Jesus said to him, “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’” \n', 'Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him. \n', 'Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. \n', 'Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, \n', 'that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, \n', '“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, towards the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, \n', 'the people who sat in darkness saw a great light; to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light has dawned.” \n', 'From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, “Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.” \n', 'Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. \n', 'He said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men.” \n', 'They immediately left their nets and followed him. \n', 'Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them. \n', 'They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him. \n', 'Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness amongst the people. \n', 'The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. \n', 'Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 5.\n', 'Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. \n', 'He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, \n', '“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. \n', 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. \n', 'Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. \n', 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. \n', 'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. \n', 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. \n', 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. \n', 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. \n', '“Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. \n', 'Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. \n', '“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavour, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. \n', 'You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. \n', 'Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. \n', 'Even so, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. \n', '“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfil. \n', 'For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. \n', 'Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. \n', 'For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. \n', '“You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’ and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgement.’ \n', 'But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgement. Whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna. \n', '“If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, \n', 'leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. \n', 'Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. \n', 'Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny. \n', '“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery;’ \n', 'but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. \n', 'If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. \n', 'If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. \n', '“It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,’ \n', 'but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery. \n', '“Again you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,’ \n', 'but I tell you, don’t swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; \n', 'nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. \n', 'Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black. \n', 'But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one. \n', '“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ \n', 'But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. \n', 'If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. \n', 'Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. \n', 'Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you. \n', '“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.’ \n', 'But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, \n', 'that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. \n', 'For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? \n', 'If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? \n', 'Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 6.\n', '“Be careful that you don’t do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. \n', 'Therefore, when you do merciful deeds, don’t sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward. \n', 'But when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does, \n', 'so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. \n', '“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward. \n', 'But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. \n', 'In praying, don’t use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. \n', 'Therefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him. \n', 'Pray like this: “‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. \n', 'Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. \n', 'Give us today our daily bread. \n', 'Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. \n', 'Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.’ \n', '“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. \n', 'But if you don’t forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. \n', '“Moreover when you fast, don’t be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward. \n', 'But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, \n', 'so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you. \n', '“Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal; \n', 'but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don’t break through and steal; \n', 'for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. \n', '“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light. \n', 'But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! \n', '“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon. \n', 'Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothing? \n', 'See the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you of much more value than they? \n', '“Which of you by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan? \n', 'Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin, \n', 'yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. \n', 'But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith? \n', '“Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’ \n', 'For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. \n', 'But seek first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well. \n', 'Therefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 7.\n', '“Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged. \n', 'For with whatever judgement you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you. \n', 'Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye? \n', 'Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye? \n', 'You hypocrite!

Depart from me, you who work iniquity.’ \n', '“Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock. \n', 'The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock. \n', 'Everyone who hears these words of mine and doesn’t do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. \n', 'The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell—and its fall was great.” \n', 'When Jesus had finished saying these things, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching, \n', 'for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 8.\n', 'When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. \n', 'Behold, a leper came to him and worshipped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” \n', 'Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. \n', 'Jesus said to him, “See that you tell nobody; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.” \n', 'When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help, \n', 'saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralysed, grievously tormented.” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” \n', 'The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. \n', 'For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” \n', 'When Jesus heard it, he marvelled and said to those who followed, “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. \n', 'I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, \n', 'but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” \n', 'Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way.

We are dying!” \n', 'He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. \n', 'The men marvelled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” \n', 'When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. \n', 'Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” \n', 'Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. \n', 'The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.” \n', 'He said to them, “Go!” They came out and went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. \n', 'Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. \n', 'Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus.

"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 9.\n', 'He entered into a boat and crossed over, and came into his own city. \n', 'Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralysed, lying on a bed.

Your sins are forgiven you.” \n', 'Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.” \n', 'Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts? \n', 'For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’ \n', 'But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” (then he said to the paralytic), “Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.” \n', 'He arose and departed to his house. \n', 'But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. \n', 'As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office.

Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour. \n', 'When Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder, \n', 'he said to them, “Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.” They were ridiculing him. \n', 'But when the crowd was sent out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. \n', 'The report of this went out into all that land. \n', 'As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David!” \n', 'When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They told him, “Yes, Lord.” \n', 'Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it done to you.” \n', 'Then their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.” \n', 'But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land. \n', 'As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. \n', 'When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke.

"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 13.\n', 'On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside. \n', 'Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. \n', 'He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, a farmer went out to sow. \n', 'As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them. \n', 'Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth. \n', 'When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away. \n', 'Others fell amongst thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them. \n', 'Others fell on good soil and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. \n', 'He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” \n', 'The disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” \n', 'He answered them, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them. \n', 'For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. \n', 'Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand. \n', 'In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, ‘By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive; \n', 'for this people’s heart has grown callous, their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.’ \n', '“But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. \n', 'For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them. \n', '“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. \n', 'When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside. \n', 'What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it; \n', 'yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles. \n', 'What was sown amongst the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. \n', 'What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.” \n', 'He set another parable before them, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, \n', 'but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also amongst the wheat, and went away. \n', 'But when the blade sprang up and produced grain, then the darnel weeds appeared also. \n', 'The servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’ \n', '“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’ \n', '“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them. \n', 'Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’” \n', 'He set another parable before them, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took, and sowed in his field, \n', 'which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.” \n', 'He spoke another parable to them. “The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.” \n', 'Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them, \n', 'that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.” \n', 'Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.” \n', 'He answered them, “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, \n', 'the field is the world, the good seeds are the children of the Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. \n', 'The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. \n', 'As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burnt with fire; so will it be at the end of this age. \n', 'The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those who do iniquity, \n', 'and will cast them into the furnace of fire.

If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.” \n', 'Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.” \n', 'So Jesus said, “Do you also still not understand? \n', 'Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? \n', 'But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. \n', 'For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. \n', 'These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.” \n', 'Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. \n', 'Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!” \n', 'But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.” \n', 'But he answered, “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” \n', 'But she came and worshipped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” \n', 'But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” \n', 'But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” \n', 'Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour. \n', 'Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there. \n', 'Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, \n', 'so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel. \n', 'Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.” \n', 'The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?” \n', 'Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” \n', 'He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; \n', 'and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. \n', 'They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. \n', 'Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. \n', 'Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 16.\n', 'The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. \n', 'But he answered them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ \n', 'In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! \n', 'An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” He left them and departed. \n', 'The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. \n', 'Jesus said to them, “Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” \n', 'They reasoned amongst themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” \n', 'Jesus, perceiving it, said, “Why do you reason amongst yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread? \n', 'Don’t you yet perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up, \n', 'or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? \n', 'How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” \n', 'Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. \n', 'Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, “Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?” \n', 'They said, “Some say John the Baptiser, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” \n', 'He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” \n', 'Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” \n', 'Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. \n', 'I also tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. \n', 'I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.” \n', 'Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. \n', 'From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. \n', 'Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.” \n', 'But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.” \n', 'Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. \n', 'For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. \n', 'For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? \n', 'For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds. \n', 'Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 17.\n', 'After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. \n', 'He was changed before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. \n', 'Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. \n', 'Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” \n', 'While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.” \n', 'When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. \n', 'Jesus came and touched them and said, “Get up, and don’t be afraid.” \n', 'Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone. \n', 'As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” \n', 'His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” \n', 'Jesus answered them, “Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things; \n', 'but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognise him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.” \n', 'Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptiser. \n', 'When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him and saying, \n', '“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. \n', 'So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.” \n', 'Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.” \n', 'Jesus rebuked the demon, and it went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. \n', 'Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?” \n', 'He said to them, “Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. \n', 'But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.” \n', 'While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, \n', 'and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” They were exceedingly sorry. \n', 'When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?” \n', 'He said, “Yes.” When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?” \n', 'Peter said to him, “From strangers.” Jesus said to him, “Therefore the children are exempt. \n', 'But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you.” \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 18.\n', 'In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” \n', 'Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the middle of them \n', 'and said, “Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. \n', 'Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. \n', 'Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me, \n', 'but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a huge millstone were hung around his neck and that he were sunk in the depths of the sea. \n', '“Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes! \n', 'If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. \n', 'If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire. \n', 'See that you don’t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. \n', 'For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost. \n', '“What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray? \n', 'If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. \n', 'Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. \n', '“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. \n', 'But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. \n', 'If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. \n', 'Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven. \n', 'Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. \n', 'For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.” \n', 'Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven. \n', 'Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. \n', 'When he had begun to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. \n', 'But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. \n', 'The servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’ \n', 'The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. \n', '“But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’ \n', '“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’ \n', 'He would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay back that which was due. \n', 'So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their lord all that was done. \n', 'Then his lord called him in and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. \n', 'Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ \n', 'His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him. \n', 'So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.” \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 19.\n', 'When Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. \n', 'Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. \n', 'Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?” \n', 'He answered, “Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, \n', 'and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?’ \n', 'So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.” \n', 'They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?” \n', 'He said to them, “Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. \n', 'I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.” \n', 'His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.” \n', 'But he said to them, “Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given. \n', 'For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.” \n', 'Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. \n', 'But Jesus said, “Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.” \n', 'He laid his hands on them, and departed from there. \n', 'Behold, one came to him and said, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” \n', 'He said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” \n', 'He said to him, “Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer false testimony.’ \n', '‘Honour your father and your mother.’ And, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’” \n', 'The young man said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?” \n', 'Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” \n', 'But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions. \n', 'Jesus said to his disciples, “Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. \n', 'Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.” \n', 'When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” \n', 'Looking at them, Jesus said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” \n', 'Then Peter answered, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” \n', 'Jesus said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \n', 'Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life. \n', 'But many will be last who are first, and first who are last. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 20.\n', '“For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard. \n', 'When he had agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. \n', 'He went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. \n', 'He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went their way. \n', 'Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. \n', 'About the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle. He said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’ \n', '“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ “He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ \n', '“When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the labourers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’ \n', '“When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. \n', 'When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius. \n', 'When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household, \n', 'saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’ \n', '“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong.

Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with?” They said to him, “We are able.” \n', 'He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” \n', 'When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers. \n', 'But Jesus summoned them, and said, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. \n', 'It shall not be so amongst you; but whoever desires to become great amongst you shall be your servant. \n', 'Whoever desires to be first amongst you shall be your bondservant, \n', 'even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” \n', 'As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. \n', 'Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!” \n', 'The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!” \n', 'Jesus stood still and called them, and asked, “What do you want me to do for you?” \n', 'They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” \n', 'Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 21.\n', 'When they came near to Jerusalem and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, \n', 'saying to them, “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her.

"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 22.\n', 'Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying, \n', '“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding feast for his son, \n', 'and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. \n', 'Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner.

Whose son is he?” They said to him, “Of David.” \n', 'He said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, \n', '‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet’? \n', '“If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?” \n', 'No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forward. \n']"

You see to it.” \n', 'All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!” \n', 'Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. \n', 'Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him. \n', 'They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. \n', 'They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” \n', 'They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. \n', 'When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. \n', 'As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross. \n', 'When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,” \n', 'they gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. \n', 'When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing amongst them, casting lots, \n', 'and they sat and watched him there. \n', 'They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” \n', 'Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left. \n', 'Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads \n', 'and saying, “You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” \n', 'Likewise the chief priests also mocking with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said, \n', '“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. \n', 'He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” \n', 'The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach. \n', 'Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. \n', 'About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?” That is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” \n', 'Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.” \n', 'Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. \n', 'The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.” \n', 'Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. \n', 'Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. \n', 'The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; \n', 'and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many. \n', 'Now the centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!” \n', 'Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. \n', 'Amongst them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. \n', 'When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple, came. \n', 'This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. \n', 'Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth \n', 'and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. \n', 'Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. \n', 'Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, \n', 'saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’ \n', 'Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” \n', 'Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” \n', 'So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. \n']"
"['\ufeffMatthew.\n', 'Chapter 28.\n', 'Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. \n', 'Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. \n', 'His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. \n', 'For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. \n', 'The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. \n', 'He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. \n', 'Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” \n', 'They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. \n', 'As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. \n', 'Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.” \n', 'Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. \n', 'When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, \n', 'saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. \n', 'If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” \n', 'So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad amongst the Jews, and continues until today. \n', 'But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. \n', 'When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted. \n', 'Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. \n', 'Go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \n', 'teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. \n']"
