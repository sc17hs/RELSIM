87|1|Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,
87|2|Who created all things and fashioned them in good proportion;
87|3|Who determined and guided them,
87|4|Who brought forth the pasture,
87|5|and then made it into a blackish straw.
87|6|We shall make you recite and then you will not forget,
87|7|except what Allah should wish. He knows all that is manifest and all that is hidden.
87|8|We shall ease you to follow the way of Ease.
87|9|So render good counsel if good counsel will avail.
87|10|He who fears (Allah) shall heed it,
87|11|but the wretched will turn away from it.
87|12|He will be cast into the Great Fire.
87|13|Then he will neither die in it, nor live.
87|14|He who purified himself shall prosper,
87|15|remembering his Lord's name and praying.
87|16|No; but you prefer the present life,
87|17|whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring.
87|18|This, indeed, was in the ancient Scrolls,
87|19|the Scrolls of Abraham and Moses.
