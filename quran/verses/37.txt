37|1|By those who range themselves in rows;
37|2|by those who reprove severely,
37|3|and those who recite the Exhortation;
37|4|surely your God is One,
37|5|the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatever lies between the two, the Lord of the Easts.
37|6|We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars
37|7|and have protected it from every rebellious satan.
37|8|These satans cannot listen to what transpires in the High Council for they are pelted away from every side
37|9|and are repelled. Theirs is an unceasing chastisement.
37|10|And if any is able to snatch a fragment, he is pursued by a piercing flame.
37|11|So ask them (that is, human beings): “Were they harder to create than the objects We created?” We created them from sticky clay.
37|12|You marvel (at the wondrous creations of Allah) and they scoff at it,
37|13|and when they are admonished, they pay no heed;
37|14|and if they see any Sign, they laugh it away
37|15|and say: “This is nothing but plain sorcery.
37|16|Is it ever possible that after we die and are reduced to dust and (a skeleton of) bones, we will be raised to life?
37|17|And so also shall our forefathers of yore be raised to life?”
37|18|Tell them: “Yes; and you are utterly helpless (against Allah).”
37|19|There will be a single stern rebuff and lo, they will be observing with their own eyes (all that they had been warned against).
37|20|They will then say: “Woe for us. This is the Day of Judgement.”
37|21|“Yes, this is the Day of Final Decision that you used to deny as a lie.”
37|22|(Then will the command be given): “Muster all the wrong-doers and their spouses and the deities whom they used to serve
37|23|apart from Allah, and direct them to the path of Hell,
37|24|and detain them there; they will be called to account.
37|25|How is it that you are not helping one another?
37|26|Indeed, today they are surrendering themselves completely.”
37|27|They will then turn towards each other (and start wrangling).
37|28|(The followers will say to their leaders): “You used to come to us from the right hand.”
37|29|They will say: “Nay, you yourselves were not the ones who would believe.
37|30|We had no power over you. You were a rebellious people,
37|31|and so we became deserving of the Word of our Lord that we shall be made to suffer chastisement.
37|32|So we led you astray; we ourselves were strayed.”
37|33|On that Day, they will all share the chastisement.
37|34|Thus do We treat the culprits.
37|35|Whenever it was said to them: “There is no true deity apart from Allah,” they waxed proud
37|36|and said: “Shall we forsake our deities for the sake of a distracted poet?”
37|37|(They say so although) he brought the Truth and confirmed the veracity of the Messengers.
37|38|(They will be told): “You shall taste the grievous chastisement.
37|39|You will only be recompensed according to your deeds.”
37|40|But Allah's chosen servants (shall be spared this woeful end).
37|41|For them awaits a known provision,
37|42|a variety of delicious fruits; and they shall be honoured
37|43|in the Gardens of Bliss.
37|44|They will be seated upon couches set face to face;
37|45|a cup filled with wine from its springs, will be passed around to them;
37|46|white, sparkling (wine), a delight to the drinkers.
37|47|There will neither be any harm in it for their body nor will it intoxicate their mind.
37|48|Theirs shall be wide-eyed maidens with bashful, restrained glances,
37|49|so delicate as the hidden peel under an egg's shell.
37|50|Then some of them will turn to others, and will ask each other.
37|51|One of them will say: “I had a companion in the world
37|52|who used to say: -- Are you also one of those who confirm the Truth (of life after death)?
37|53|After we are dead and have become all dust and bones shall we still be requited?'
37|54|He will say: -- Do you wish to know where he is now?'
37|55|Then he will look downwards, and will see him in the depths of Hell.
37|56|He will say to him: -- By Allah, you almost ruined me.
37|57|But for Allah's favour, I should be one of those who have been mustered here.
37|58|So, are we not going to die,
37|59|except for our first death? And shall we suffer no chastisement?'”
37|60|Surely this is the supreme triumph.
37|61|For the like of it should the workers work.
37|62|Is this a better hospitality or the tree of al-Zaqqum?
37|63|We have made this tree a trial for the wrong-doers.
37|64|It is a tree that grows in the nethermost part of Hell.
37|65|Its spathes are like the heads of satans.
37|66|(The people of Hell) will surely eat of it, filling their bellies with it.
37|67|Then on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water.
37|68|Then their return will be to the same blazing Hell.
37|69|These are the ones who found their fathers steeped in error,
37|70|and they are running in their footsteps.
37|71|Before them a multitude of people of olden times had erred,
37|72|and We had sent among them Messengers to warn them.
37|73|Observe, then, what was the end of those that had been warned,
37|74|except for the chosen servants of Allah?
37|75|Noah had called upon Us (earlier). See, how excellent We were in answering him!
37|76|We delivered him and his household from the great calamity;
37|77|and made his offspring the only ones to survive,
37|78|and We established for him a good name among posterity.
37|79|Peace be upon Noah among all the nations.
37|80|Thus do We reward all those who do good.
37|81|Surely he was one of Our truly believing servants.
37|82|Thereafter We caused the others to be drowned.
37|83|Abraham was on the self-same way (as Noah).
37|84|When he came to his Lord with a pure heart,
37|85|and said to his father and his people: “Whom do you worship?
37|86|Is it false deities that you want to serve rather than Allah?
37|87|What do you think of the Lord of the whole Universe?”
37|88|Then he looked carefully at the stars
37|89|and said: “I am sick.”
37|90|So turning their backs, they went away from him.
37|91|Then he went quietly to the (temple of the deities) and said: “What is the matter with you, why do you not eat?
37|92|What is the matter with you, why do you not speak?”
37|93|Then he turned upon them, striking them with his right hand,
37|94|whereupon people came to him running.
37|95|Abraham said to them: “Do you worship what you yourselves have carved with your own hands
37|96|while it is Allah Who has created you and all that you make?”
37|97|They spoke among themselves: “Build him a pyre and then throw him into the furnace.”
37|98|They had contrived an evil plan against him, but We abased them all.
37|99|Abraham said: “I am going to my Lord; He will guide me.
37|100|Lord, grant me a righteous son.”
37|101|(In response to this prayer) We gave him the good news of a prudent boy;
37|102|and when he was old enough to go about and work with him, (one day) Abraham said to him: “My son, I see in my dream that I am slaughtering you. So consider (and tell me) what you think.” He said: “Do as you are bidden. You will find me, if Allah so wills, among the steadfast.”
37|103|When both surrendered (to Allah's command) and Abraham flung the son down on his forehead,
37|104|We cried out: “O Abraham,
37|105|you have indeed fulfilled your dream. Thus do We reward the good-doers.”
37|106|This was indeed a plain trial.
37|107|And We ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice,
37|108|and We preserved for him a good name among posterity.
37|109|Peace be upon Abraham.
37|110|Thus do We reward the good-doers.
37|111|Surely he was one of Our believing servants.
37|112|And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a Prophet and among the righteous ones.
37|113|And We blessed him and Isaac. Among the offspring of the two some did good and some plainly wronged themselves.
37|114|Verily We bestowed Our favours on Moses and Aaron
37|115|and We delivered both of them and their people from the great calamity.
37|116|We succoured them, and they gained the upper hand (against their enemies).
37|117|We granted them a Clear Book,
37|118|and showed them the Straight Way,
37|119|and preserved for them a good name among posterity.
37|120|Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.
37|121|Thus do We reward the good-doers.
37|122|Surely both of them were among Our believing servants.
37|123|Surely, Elias too was among the Messengers.
37|124|(Call to mind) when he said to his people: “Will you not fear Allah?
37|125|Do you call upon Baal and forsake the Best of the Creators?
37|126|Allah is your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of yore.”
37|127|But they denounced him as a liar, so they will surely be arraigned (for punishment),
37|128|except Allah's chosen servants.
37|129|We preserved a good name for him among posterity.
37|130|Peace be upon Elias.
37|131|Thus do We reward the good-doers.
37|132|He was one of Our believing servants.
37|133|And Lot too was one of the Messengers.
37|134|(Call to mind) when We delivered him and all his kinsfolk,
37|135|except for an old woman who was among those that stayed behind.
37|136|Then We utterly destroyed the rest of them.
37|137|You pass by their desolate habitations in the morning
37|138|and at night. Do you still not understand?
37|139|And Jonah too was one of the Messengers.
37|140|Call to mind when he fled to the laden ship,
37|141|cast lots, and was among the losers.
37|142|Then a fish swallowed him, and he was blameworthy.
37|143|Had he not been one of those who glorify Allah,
37|144|he would certainly have remained in its belly till the Day of Resurrection.
37|145|But We threw him on a wide bare tract of land while he was ill;
37|146|and caused a gourd tree to grow over him,
37|147|and We sent him forth to a nation of a hundred thousand or more,
37|148|and they believed. So We let them enjoy life for a while.
37|149|So ask their opinion: “(Are you convinced) that your Lord should have daughters and you should have sons?
37|150|Did We create the angels as females the while they witnessed?”
37|151|Behold, it is one of their fabrications that they say:
37|152|“Allah has begotten.” They are liars!
37|153|Did He choose daughters rather than sons?
37|154|What is the matter with you that you make such strange judgements?
37|155|Will you then not take heed?
37|156|Do you have any clear authority for such claims?
37|157|Bring your Book, if you are truthful.
37|158|They have established a kinship between Allah and the angels; and the angels know well that these people will be arraigned (as culprits).
37|159|(They say): “Exalted be Allah above what they attribute to Him,
37|160|all of them except the chosen servants of Allah.
37|161|So you and your deities
37|162|shall not be able to tempt anyone away from Allah
37|163|except him who shall roast in the Blazing Fire.
37|164|As for us, there is none but has an appointed station.
37|165|Verily we range ourselves in rows (as humble servants)
37|166|and we are of those who glorify Allah.”
37|167|They used to say before:
37|168|“If only we had the Reminder which had been granted to the people of yore
37|169|we would surely have been Allah's chosen servants.”
37|170|But when it came to them, they rejected it. They shall soon come to know (the end of such an attitude).
37|171|We have already given Our promise to Our Messengers
37|172|that they shall certainly be succoured,
37|173|and that Our hosts shall triumph.
37|174|So, (O Prophet), leave them alone for a while,
37|175|and see, and soon they too shall see.
37|176|Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?
37|177|When that chastisement will descend upon their courtyard, evil shall that Day be for those who had been warned.
37|178|Leave them alone for a while,
37|179|and see; and they too shall soon see.
37|180|Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, above what they attribute to Him,
37|181|and peace be upon the Messengers,
37|182|and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.
