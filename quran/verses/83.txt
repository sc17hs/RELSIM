83|1|Woe to the stinters;
83|2|those who, when they take from others by measure, take their full share;
83|3|but who, when they measure or weigh for others, give less than their due.
83|4|Do they not realise that they will be raised to life
83|5|on a Great Day,
83|6|a Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe?
83|7|No indeed! Verily the deeds of the wicked are in the Record locked up in the prison-house!
83|8|And how would you know what the Record of the prison-house is?
83|9|It is a Book inscribed.
83|10|Woe, then, to those that give the lie,
83|11|those that give the lie to the Day of Recompense.
83|12|Yet none gives the lie to it except the transgressor immersed in sin;
83|13|who, when Our verses are recited to him, says: “Mere tales of olden times!”
83|14|No indeed! The truth is that their hearts have become rusted on account of their evil deeds.
83|15|No indeed! On that Day they will be screened off from seeing their Lord,
83|16|and then they shall enter Hell,
83|17|whereafter they will be told: “This is what you used to give the lie to.”
83|18|No indeed! Verily, the deeds of the virtuous shall be in the record of the exalted ones.
83|19|And what do you know what the Record of the exalted ones is?
83|20|It is a Book inscribed,
83|21|which the angels placed near Allah to safeguard.
83|22|Verily the virtuous shall be in Bliss;
83|23|resting on couches, looking around.
83|24|You shall see upon their faces the glow of bliss.
83|25|They will be served a drink of the finest sealed wine,
83|26|whose seal is musk – so let all aspirants aspire after that –
83|27|a wine whose mixture is Tasnim,
83|28|a fountain at which the chosen ones shall drink.
83|29|Behold, the wicked were wont to laugh at the believers:
83|30|when they passed by them they winked,
83|31|and when they went back to their families, they went back jesting,
83|32|and when they saw the believers, they said: “Lo! These are the erring ones”;
83|33|(they said so although) they had not been appointed watchers over them.
83|34|But today the believers are laughing at the unbelievers;
83|35|seated upon their couches, they are looking around.
83|36|Have the unbelievers been duly rewarded for their deeds?
