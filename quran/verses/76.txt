76|1|Was there a period of time when man was not even worthy of a mention?
76|2|Verily We created man out of a drop of intermingled sperm so that We might try him, and We therefore endowed him with hearing and sight.
76|3|Surely We showed him the Right Path, regardless of whether he chooses to be thankful or unthankful (to his Lord).
76|4|For the unbelievers, We have kept ready chains and fetters and a Blazing Fire.
76|5|The virtuous shall drink from a cup tempered with camphor water.
76|6|This will be a gushing spring wherefrom Allah's servants shall drink wine, a spring from which they will take out channels wherever they wish.
76|7|These will be the ones who fulfil their vows and dread the Day whose woe shall be spread far and wide;
76|8|those who, for the love of Him, feed the needy, and the orphan, and the captive,
76|9|(saying): “We feed you only for Allah's sake; we do not seek of you any recompense or thanks,
76|10|we fear from our Lord a Day that shall be long and distressful.”
76|11|So Allah shall guard them against the woe of that Day, and will procure them freshness and joy,
76|12|and will reward them for their steadfastness with Paradise and robes of silk.
76|13|There they will recline on elevated couches and will be subjected neither to the burning heat of the sun nor to bitter cold.
76|14|The shades of Paradise will bend over them, and its fruits will be brought within their easy reach;
76|15|and there shall be passed around them vessels of silver and goblets of crystal,
76|16|goblets bright as crystal but made of silver, filled to exact measure.
76|17|Therein they shall be served a cup flavoured with ginger,
76|18|drawn from a spring (in Paradise) called Salsabil.
76|19|There boys of everlasting youth shall go about attending them: when you see them, you would think that they are scattered pearls.
76|20|Whitherto you look around, you will see an abundance of bliss and the glories of a great kingdom.
76|21|They [i.e., the virtuous] shall be attired in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade and will be adorned with bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them a pure wine to drink.
76|22|Behold, this is your recompense and your endeavour has been appreciated.
76|23|(O Prophet), indeed We have revealed the Qur'an to you in portions.
76|24|So persevere with the command of your Lord and do not pay any heed to the wicked and the unbelieving,
76|25|and remember the name of your Lord, morning and evening;
76|26|and prostrate yourself before Him at night, and extol His Glory during the long watches of the night.
76|27|Verily they love (the good of this world) that is hastily obtainable and are oblivious of the burdensome Day ahead of them.
76|28|We created them and strengthened their joints; and whenever We wish, We can change their faces entirely.
76|29|Verily this is an Exhortation; so let him who so will take a way to his Lord.
76|30|But your willing shall be of no avail until Allah Himself so wills. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
76|31|He admits to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases. As for the wrong-doers, He has prepared for them a grievous chastisement.
