94|1|(O Prophet), Did We not lay open your breast
94|2|and relieve you of the burden
94|3|that had well-nigh broken your back?
94|4|And did We not exalt your fame?
94|5|Indeed, there is ease with hardship.
94|6|Most certainly, there is ease with hardship.
94|7|So, whenever you are free, strive in devotion,
94|8|and turn to your Lord with longing.
