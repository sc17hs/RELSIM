92|1|By the night when it enshrouds,
92|2|and by the day when it breaks in its glory,
92|3|and by Him Who created the male and the female:
92|4|surely your strivings are divergent.
92|5|As for him who gave out his wealth (for Allah's sake) and abstained (from disobeying Him),
92|6|and affirmed the Truth of goodness:
92|7|We shall facilitate for him the Way to Bliss.
92|8|As for him who was a miser and behaved with aversion (to Allah),
92|9|and denied the Truth of goodness:
92|10|We shall facilitate for him the way to Hardship,
92|11|and his wealth shall be of no avail to him when he perishes.
92|12|Surely it is for Us to show the Right Way,
92|13|and to Us belong the Next Life and the present.
92|14|I have now warned you of a Blazing Fire,
92|15|where none shall burn except the most wicked,
92|16|who rejected the Truth, calling it falsehood and turned his back on it.
92|17|But the God-fearing shall be kept away from it,
92|18|the Godfearing who spends his wealth to purify himself;
92|19|not as payment for any favours that he received,
92|20|but only to seek the good pleasure of his Lord Most High.
92|21|He will surely be well-pleased (with him).
