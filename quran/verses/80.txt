80|1|He frowned and turned away
80|2|that the blind man came to him.
80|3|How could you know? Perhaps he would cleanse himself,
80|4|or he might be mindful and good counsel might avail him.
80|5|Now he who waxes indifferent,
80|6|you attend to him,
80|7|though you are not to blame if he would not cleanse himself.
80|8|But he who comes to you running,
80|9|and fears (Allah),
80|10|you pay no heed to him.
80|11|No indeed; this is only a Reminder.
80|12|So whoso wills may give heed to it.
80|13|It is contained in scrolls highly honoured,
80|14|most exalted and purified,
80|15|borne by the hands of scribes,
80|16|noble and purified.
80|17|Accursed be man! How stubbornly he denies the Truth.
80|18|Out of what did Allah create him?
80|19|Out of a sperm-drop did He create him and then determined a measure for him,
80|20|and then made the course of life easy for him,
80|21|then He caused him to die and brought him to the grave,
80|22|and then, whenever He wishes, He will raise him back to life.
80|23|Nay, but man did not fulfil what Allah had enjoined upon him.
80|24|So let man just consider his food:
80|25|We poured water, pouring it in great abundance,
80|26|and cleaved the earth, cleaving it asunder;
80|27|then caused the grain to grow out of it,
80|28|together with grapes and vegetables,
80|29|and olives and palms,
80|30|and dense orchards,
80|31|and fruits and pastures â€“
80|32|all this as a provision for you and your cattle.
80|33|But when the deafening cry shall be sounded
80|34|on the Day when each man shall flee from his brother,
80|35|and his mother and his father;
80|36|and his consort and his children;
80|37|on that Day each will be occupied with his own business, making him oblivious of all save himself.
80|38|Some faces on that Day shall be beaming with happiness,
80|39|and be cheerful and joyous.
80|40|Some faces on that Day shall be dust-ridden,
80|41|enveloped by darkness.
80|42|These will be the unbelievers, the wicked.
