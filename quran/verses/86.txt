86|1|By the heaven, and the night-visitor,
86|2|what do you know what the night-visitor is?
86|3|It is the piercing star.
86|4|There is no living being but there is a protector over it.
86|5|So let man consider of what he was created.
86|6|He was created of a gushing fluid,
86|7|emanating from between the loins and the ribs.
86|8|Surely He (the Creator) has the power to bring him back (to life).
86|9|On the Day when man's deepest secrets shall be put to the test
86|10|he shall have no power, and no helper.
86|11|By the heaven with its recurring cycle of rain,
86|12|and by the earth ever bursting with verdure,
86|13|this (Qur'an) is surely a decisive Word,
86|14|not a flippant jest.
86|15|They are devising a guile,
86|16|and I too am devising a guile.
86|17|So leave the unbelievers to themselves; respite them awhile.
