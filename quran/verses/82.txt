82|1|When the heaven is split asunder,
82|2|when the stars are scattered,
82|3|when the seas are made to burst forth,
82|4|and when graves are laid open,
82|5|everyone shall know all his deeds, both the earlier and the later.
82|6|O man! What has deceived you about your generous Lord
82|7|Who created you, shaped you, and made you well-proportioned,
82|8|and set you in whatever form He pleased?
82|9|No indeed; (the fact is that) you deny the Reckoning, declaring it a lie;
82|10|you do so the while there are watchers over you;
82|11|noble scribes,
82|12|who know what you do.
82|13|Surely the virtuous shall be in Bliss,
82|14|and the wicked shall be in the Blazing Fire.
82|15|They shall enter it on the Day of Recompense
82|16|and then shall never come out of it.
82|17|What do you know what the Day of Recompense is?
82|18|Again, what do you know what the Day of Recompense is?
82|19|It is the Day when no one shall have the power to do anything for another, and all command shall be Allah's.
