107|1|Did you see him who gives the lie to the Reward and Punishment of the Hereafter?
107|2|Such is the one who repulses the orphans away,
107|3|and urges not the feeding of the needy.
107|4|Woe, then, to those who pray,
107|5|but are heedless in their Prayers,
107|6|those who do good (in order) to be seen,
107|7|and deny people the articles of common necessity.
