51|1|By the winds which scatter dust,
51|2|which carry clouds laden with water,
51|3|which then smoothly speed along,
51|4|and execute the great task of apportioning (rainfall):
51|5|surely what you are being warned against is true,
51|6|and the Judgement shall doubtlessly take place.
51|7|By the heaven with its numerous forms:
51|8|surely you are at variance (about the Hereafter);
51|9|though only those who are averse to the Truth will turn away from (believing in it).
51|10|Doomed are the conjecturers
51|11|who are steeped in ignorance and heedlessness.
51|12|They ask: “When will the Day of Judgement be?”
51|13|It will be the Day when they shall be scourged by the Fire
51|14|(and be told): “Taste your ordeal! This is what you were seeking to hasten.”
51|15|As for the God-fearing, they shall be in the midst of gardens and fountains,
51|16|joyously receiving what their Lord will have granted them. Verily they did good works before (the coming of this Day):
51|17|they used to sleep but little by night,
51|18|and would ask for forgiveness at dawn,
51|19|and in their wealth there was a rightful share for him who would ask and for the destitute.
51|20|There are many Signs on earth for those of sure faith,
51|21|and also in your own selves. Do you not see?
51|22|And in heaven is your provision and also what you are being promised.
51|23|So, by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, this is certainly true, as true as the fact of your speaking.
51|24|(O Prophet), did the story of Abraham's honoured guests reach you?
51|25|When they came to him, they said: “Peace”; he said: “Peace also be to you; (you seem to be) a group of strangers.”
51|26|Then he went back to his family and brought a fat roasted calf
51|27|and laid it before them, saying: “Will you not eat?”
51|28|Then he became afraid of them. They said: “Fear not,” and announced to him the good news of (the birth of) a boy endowed with knowledge.
51|29|So hearing his wife went forth shouting. She struck her face and exclaimed: “A barren old woman am I.”
51|30|They said: “So has your Lord said (that you shall have a boy). Surely He is Most Wise, All-Knowing.”
51|31|Abraham said: “Envoys (of Allah), what is your errand?”
51|32|They replied: “Behold, we have been sent to a wicked people
51|33|that we may unleash a shower of clay-stones
51|34|marked by your Lord upon those who go beyond the limits.”
51|35|Then We evacuated there from all the believers
51|36|– and We did not find there any, apart from a single house of Muslims –
51|37|and We left therein a Sign for those who fear the grievous chastisement.
51|38|There is also a Sign for you in the story of Moses when We sent him with a clear authority to Pharaoh.
51|39|But Pharaoh turned away, showing arrogance on account of his power, and said (about Moses): “He is either a sorcerer or a madman.”
51|40|So We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea. He became an object of much blame.
51|41|There is also a Sign for you in (the story of) Ad, when We let loose upon them an ominous wind
51|42|that left nothing that it came upon without reducing it to rubble.
51|43|There is also a Sign for you in (the story of) Thamud. They were told: “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”
51|44|But they brazenly disobeyed their Lord's command, and then a sudden chastisement overtook them while they looked on.
51|45|They were unable even to stand up or protect themselves.
51|46|Before all these We destroyed the people of Noah: they were a wicked people.
51|47|And heaven – We made it with Our Own Power and We have the Power to do so.
51|48|And the earth – We spread it out, and how well have We smoothed it!
51|49|And of everything We have created pairs; perhaps you will take heed.
51|50|Flee, therefore, to Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him;
51|51|and do not set up any deity with Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him.
51|52|Thus has it been (in the past): never did a Messenger come to the nations that preceded them but they said: “(He is) a sorcerer, or a mad-man.”
51|53|Have they arrived at a common understanding concerning this? No; but they are a people given to transgression.
51|54|So turn your attention away from them; you shall incur no blame.
51|55|Do, however, keep exhorting them; for exhortation benefits those endowed with faith.
51|56|I created the jinn and humans for nothing else but that they may serve Me;
51|57|I desire from them no provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.
51|58|Surely Allah is the Bestower of all provision, the Lord of all power, the Strong.
51|59|The wrong-doers shall receive a portion of the chastisements as their fellows (of yore). So let them not rush Me.
51|60|Woe, then, betide those who disbelieved in that Day of theirs which they are being asked to hold in dread.
