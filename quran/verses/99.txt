99|1|When the earth will be shaken with a mighty shaking,
99|2|and the earth will throw up all her burdens,
99|3|and man will cry out: “What is the matter with her?”
99|4|On that Day it will relate all her news,
99|5|for your Lord will have commanded her (to do so).
99|6|On that Day people will go forth in varying states so that they be shown their deeds.
99|7|So, whoever does an atom's weight of good shall see it;
99|8|and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it.
