77|1|By the (winds) sent forth in quick succession,
77|2|which then blow tempestuously
77|3|and raise (clouds) and scatter them around,
77|4|then winnow them thoroughly,
77|5|and then cast (Allah's) remembrance (in people's hearts),
77|6|to serve as an excuse or a warning.
77|7|Surely what you are promised shall come to pass.
77|8|So when the stars are extinguished,
77|9|and the sky is rent asunder,
77|10|and the mountains are blown away,
77|11|and the appointed time to bring the Messengers together arrives, (then shall the promised event come to pass).
77|12|To which Day has this task been deferred?
77|13|To the Day of Judgement.
77|14|What do you know what the Day of Judgement is?
77|15|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|16|Did We not destroy many a nation of the earlier times?
77|17|And We shall cause those of later times to follow them.
77|18|Thus do We deal with the guilty.
77|19|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|20|Did We not create you of a mean fluid,
77|21|which We then placed in a secure repository
77|22|until an appointed time?
77|23|See that We had the power to do so. Great indeed is Our power to do what We will.
77|24|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|25|Did We not make the earth a receptacle,
77|26|for the living and the dead,
77|27|and did We not firmly fix towering mountains on it and give you sweet water to drink?
77|28|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|29|Proceed now towards that which you were wont to deny as false;
77|30|proceed towards the three-pronged shadow,
77|31|which neither provides (cooling) shade nor protection against the flames;
77|32|it indeed throws up sparks like castles,
77|33|which seem as though they are yellow-coloured camels.
77|34|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|35|That will be the Day on which they will not (be able to) utter a word,
77|36|nor will they be allowed to proffer excuses.
77|37|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|38|That is the Day of Judgement on which We have assembled you as well as all those who went before you.
77|39|So if you have any ploy, try it against Me!
77|40|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|41|Behold, today the God-fearing will be amidst shades and springs,
77|42|and the fruits that they desire (will be ready at hand).
77|43|Eat and drink and may every joy attend you as a reward for your deeds.
77|44|Thus do We reward those that do good.
77|45|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|46|Eat and enjoy yourselves for a while. Surely you are evil-doers.
77|47|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|48|When it is said to them: “Bow down (before Allah),” they do not bow down.
77|49|Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth!
77|50|In what discourse after this (Qur'an) will they, then, believe?
