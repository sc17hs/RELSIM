91|1|By the sun and its heat and brightness,
91|2|and by the moon as it follows it;
91|3|and by the day as it displays the sun's glory,
91|4|and by the night as it envelopes the sun;
91|5|and by the sky and by Him Who made it;
91|6|and by the earth and by Him Who stretched it out;
91|7|and by the soul and by Him Who perfectly proportioned it,
91|8|and imbued it with (the consciousness of) its evil and its piety:
91|9|He who purifies it will prosper,
91|10|and he who suppresses it will be ruined.
91|11|In their presumptuous insolence the Thamud called the Truth a lie
91|12|when their arch-criminal rose up in rage.
91|13|Then Allah's Messenger warned them: “Hands off the she-camel and her drink!”
91|14|But they rejected his statement as a lie and hamstrung the she-camel. For that crime their Lord rumbled down upon them, utterly razing them to the ground.
91|15|He has no fear of its sequel.
