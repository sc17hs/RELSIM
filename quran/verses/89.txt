89|1|By the dawn,
89|2|and the ten nights,
89|3|and the even and the odd,
89|4|and by the night when it departs.
89|5|Is there in this an oath for one endowed with understanding?
89|6|Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Ad
89|7|of Iram, known for their lofty columns,
89|8|the like of whom no nation was ever created in the lands of the world?
89|9|And how did He deal with Thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley?
89|10|And with Pharaoh of the tent pegs
89|11|who transgressed in the countries of the world
89|12|spreading in them much corruption?
89|13|Then their Lord unloosed upon them the lash of chastisement.
89|14|Truly your Lord is ever watchful.
89|15|As for man, when his Lord tests him by exalting him and bestowing His bounties upon him, he says: “My Lord has exalted me.”
89|16|But when He tests him by straitening his sustenance, he says: “My Lord has humiliated me.”
89|17|But no; you do not treat the orphan honourably,
89|18|and do not urge one another to feed the poor,
89|19|and greedily devour the entire inheritance,
89|20|and love the riches, loving them ardently.
89|21|But no; when the earth is ground to powder,
89|22|and when your Lord appears with rows upon rows of angels,
89|23|and when Hell is brought near that Day. On that Day will man understand, but of what avail will that understanding be?
89|24|He will say: “Would that I had sent ahead what would be of avail for this life of mine!”
89|25|Then on that Day Allah will chastise as none other can chastise;
89|26|and Allah will bind as none other can bind.
89|27|(On the other hand it will be said): “O serene soul!
89|28|Return to your Lord well-pleased (with your blissful destination), well-pleasing (to your Lord).
89|29|So enter among My (righteous) servants
89|30|and enter My Paradise.”
