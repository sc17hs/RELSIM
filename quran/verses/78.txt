78|1|About what are they asking one another?
78|2|Is it about the awesome tiding
78|3|that they are in utter disagreement?
78|4|No indeed; soon will they come to know;
78|5|again, no indeed; soon will they come to know.
78|6|Have We not spread the earth like a bed,
78|7|and fixed the mountains like pegs,
78|8|and created you in pairs (as men and women),
78|9|and made your sleep a means of repose,
78|10|and made the night a covering,
78|11|and made the day to seek livelihood,
78|12|and built above you seven strong firmaments,
78|13|and placed therein a hot, shining lamp,
78|14|and sent down abundant water from the clouds
78|15|so that We may thereby bring forth grain and vegetation,
78|16|and gardens dense with foliage?
78|17|Surely the Day of Judgement has an appointed time;
78|18|the Day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and you will come forth in multitudes;
78|19|and when the sky shall be opened up and will become all doors;
78|20|and the mountains will be set in motion and become a mirage.
78|21|Surely the Hell is an ambush,
78|22|a resort for the rebellious;
78|23|therein they shall abide for ages,
78|24|they shall taste in it no coolness, nor any pleasant drink
78|25|save boiling water and wash of the wounds;
78|26|a befitting recompense for their deeds.
78|27|For indeed they did not look forward to any reckoning,
78|28|and roundly denied Our Signs as false.
78|29|And everything have We recorded in a Book.
78|30|So taste (the fruit of your deeds). We shall only increase your torment.
78|31|Surely the state of triumph awaits the God-fearing:
78|32|gardens and vineyards,
78|33|and youthful maidens of like age,
78|34|and an overflowing cup.
78|35|Therein they shall hear no idle talk, nor any falsehood;
78|36|a recompense from your Lord and an ample reward
78|37|from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of that which is between them; the Most Merciful Lord before Whom none dare utter a word.
78|38|The Day when the Spirit and the angels are ranged row on row. None shall speak save he whom the Merciful Lord will permit; and he too will speak what is right.
78|39|That Day is sure to come. So let him who will seek a resort with his Lord.
78|40|Lo! We warn you of a chastisement near at hand; the Day when a man will look on what his own hands have sent forth, and the unbelievers shall say: “Oh would that I were utter dust.”
