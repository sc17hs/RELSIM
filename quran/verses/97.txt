97|1|Behold, We revealed this (Qur'an) on the Night of Power.
97|2|And what do you know what the Night of Power is?
97|3|The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.
97|4|The angels along with the Spirit descend in it by the permission of their Lord with all kinds of decrees.
97|5|All peace is that night until the rise of dawn.
