69|1|The indubitable event!
69|2|And what is that indubitable event?
69|3|And what do you know what that indubitable event is?
69|4|The Thamud and the Ad denied the (possibility of a) sudden calamity, calling it false.
69|5|Then the Thamud were destroyed by an awesome upheaval;
69|6|and the Ad were destroyed by a furiously raging wind-storm
69|7|which He let loose upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession; so that (if you had been there) you might have seen people lying prostrate, as though they were uprooted trunks of hollowed palm trees.
69|8|Do you now see any trace of them?
69|9|Pharaoh and those before him and the people of the overturned habitations all engaged in the same great sin.
69|10|They did not follow the Messenger of their Lord, and so He seized them with a severe grip.
69|11|Verily when the water rose to great heights, We bore you upon a floating vessel (i.e. the Ark)
69|12|so that We might make it an instructive event for you, and retentive ears might preserve its memory.
69|13|So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast
69|14|and the earth and the mountains are carried aloft and are crushed to bits at one stroke,
69|15|on that Day shall that indubitable event come to pass;
69|16|when the sky will be rent asunder, the grip holding it together having loosened on that Day,
69|17|and the angels will stand on the sides, with eight of them bearing aloft the Throne of your Lord on that Day.
69|18|That will be the Day when you shall be brought forth (before Allah) and no secret of yours shall remain hidden.
69|19|On that Day, he whose Record is given to him in his right hand will say: “Lo! Read my Record!
69|20|Verily I was sure that I would be handed over my account.”
69|21|Then he shall find himself in a life of bliss;
69|22|in a lofty Garden
69|23|the clusters of whose fruit will be hanging low to be within reach (of the inmates of Paradise).
69|24|(They will be told): “Eat and drink with good cheer as a reward for the good deeds you did in the days that have passed by.”
69|25|As for him whose Record will be given to him in his left hand, he will exclaim: “Would that I had never been given my Record,
69|26|and had not known my account.
69|27|Oh! Would that the death that came to me in the world had made an end of me!
69|28|My riches have not availed me,
69|29|and my authority has vanished.”
69|30|(A command will be issued): “Seize him and shackle him,
69|31|then cast him in the Fire,
69|32|then fasten him with a chain, seventy cubits long.
69|33|He would not believe in Allah, the Most Great;
69|34|nor would he urge the feeding of the poor.
69|35|Today he has been left here friendless;
69|36|and has no food except the filth from the washing of wounds,
69|37|which only the sinners will eat.”
69|38|But no; I swear by what you see,
69|39|and by what you do not see,
69|40|that this is the speech of an honourable Messenger,
69|41|not the speech of a poet. Little do you believe!
69|42|Nor is this the speech of a soothsayer. Little do you reflect!
69|43|It has been revealed by the Lord of the Universe.
69|44|And if he [i.e., the Prophets] had forged this Discourse and thereafter ascribed it to Us,
69|45|We would surely have seized him by the right hand,
69|46|and then severed his life vein;
69|47|and not one of you would have been able to withhold Us from doing so.
69|48|Surely it is a Good Counsel for the God-fearing.
69|49|We certainly know that some among you will give the lie to it,
69|50|and surely it will be a cause of regret for the unbelievers.
69|51|Certainly it is a Truth of absolute certainty.
69|52|So glorify the name of your Lord Most Great.
