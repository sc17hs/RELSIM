81|1|When the sun shall be folded up,
81|2|when the stars shall scatter away,
81|3|when the mountains shall be set in motion,
81|4|when the ten-months pregnant camels shall be abandoned,
81|5|when the savage beasts shall be brought together,
81|6|when the seas shall be set boiling,
81|7|when the souls shall be rejoined (with their bodies),
81|8|and when the girl-child buried alive shall be asked:
81|9|for what offence was she killed?
81|10|and when the scrolls of (men's) deeds shall be unfolded,
81|11|and when Heaven is laid bare;
81|12|and Hell is stoked,
81|13|and Paradise brought nigh:
81|14|then shall each person know what he has brought along.
81|15|No indeed; I swear by the alternating stars
81|16|that hide,
81|17|and by the night as it recedes,
81|18|and the morn as it breathes.
81|19|Verily this is the word of a noble message-bearer;
81|20|one mighty and held in honour with the Lord of the Throne;
81|21|there he is obeyed and held trustworthy.
81|22|(O people of Makkah), your companion is not mad;
81|23|he indeed saw the message-bearer on the clear horizon;
81|24|nor does he grudge (conveying this knowledge about) the Unseen;
81|25|nor is it a word of an accursed Satan.
81|26|Where to are you then heading?
81|27|It is nothing but Good Counsel for everyone in the world,
81|28|for everyone of you who wishes to follow the Straight Way;
81|29|but your wishing will not avail unless Allah, the Lord of the Universe, so wishes.
