95|1|By the fig and the olive;
95|2|and by the Mount Sinai,
95|3|and by this city (of Makkah), a haven of peace:
95|4|surely We created man in the best mould;
95|5|then We reverted him to the lowest of the low,
95|6|except those who have faith and do righteous deeds. Theirs is a never ending reward.
95|7|Who, then, can give the lie to you, (O Prophet), about the Reward and the Punishment?
95|8|Is not Allah the Greatest of all sovereigns?
