101|1|The Calamity!
101|2|What is the Calamity?
101|3|And what do you know what the Calamity is?
101|4|On that Day human beings shall be like scattered moths,
101|5|and the mountains shall be like fluffs of carded wool in varying colours.
101|6|Then he whose scales weigh heavier
101|7|shall have a blissful life;
101|8|but he whose scales weigh lighter,
101|9|his shall be the deep pit for a dwelling.
101|10|And what do you know what that is?
101|11|A Blazing Fire!
