84|1|When the sky is rent asunder
84|2|and hearkens to the command of its Lord, doing what it should;
84|3|and when the earth is stretched out
84|4|and casts out what is within it and is emptied,
84|5|and hearkens to the command of its Lord, doing what it should.
84|6|O man, you are striving unto your Lord and you will meet Him.
84|7|Whoever is given the Record in his right hand
84|8|shall be called to an easy accounting,
84|9|and shall return to his people joyfully.
84|10|But he who is given the Record behind his back,
84|11|shall cry for “perdition,”
84|12|and will enter the Blazing Fire.
84|13|He used to live joyfully among his people,
84|14|thinking he would never revert (to Us).
84|15|But no; (how would he not revert)? His Lord was ever watching him.
84|16|Nay; I swear by the twilight;
84|17|and by the night and what it enfolds,
84|18|and by the moon, when it reaches its fullness:
84|19|you shall proceed onwards from stage to stage.
84|20|So, what is the matter with them that they do not believe,
84|21|and when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not prostrate themselves?
84|22|Instead, the unbelievers reject it, calling it a lie.
84|23|Allah knows best what they are accumulating (in their Record).
84|24|So give them the good news of a painful chastisement,
84|25|except for those who believe and do good deeds. Theirs shall be an unending reward.
