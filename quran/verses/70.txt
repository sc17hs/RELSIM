70|1|A beseecher besought the visitation of chastisement,
70|2|(a chastisement meant) for the unbelievers, one which none can avert;
70|3|a chastisement from Allah, the Lord of the ascending steps,
70|4|by which the angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in one Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years.
70|5|So, (O Prophet), persevere with gracious perseverance.
70|6|Verily they think that the chastisement is far off,
70|7|while We think that it is near at hand.
70|8|It shall befall on a Day whereon the sky will become like molten brass,
70|9|and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool,
70|10|and no bosom friend will enquire about any of his bosom friends
70|11|although they shall be within sight of one another. The guilty one would fain ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his children,
70|12|and his spouse and his brother,
70|13|and his kinsfolk who had stood by him,
70|14|and all persons of the earth, if only he could thus save himself.
70|15|By no means! It will be the fierce flame
70|16|that will strip off the scalp.
70|17|It shall insistently summon him who turned his back and retreated,
70|18|and amassed wealth and covetously hoarded it.
70|19|Verily man is impatient by nature:
70|20|bewailing when evil befalls him,
70|21|and tight-fisted when good fortune visits him,
70|22|except those that pray,
70|23|and are constant in their Prayer;
70|24|and those in whose wealth there is a known right
70|25|for those that ask and those that are dispossessed,
70|26|those who firmly believe in the Day of Recompense,
70|27|and fear the chastisement of their Lord –
70|28|surely the chastisement of their Lord is a thing none can feel secure from –
70|29|and those who guard their private parts,
70|30|except in regard to their spouses and those whom their right hands possess, for in regard to them they are not reproachable,
70|31|but any who seeks to go beyond that, it is indeed they who are the transgressors,
70|32|and those who fulfil their trusts and their covenants,
70|33|and those who are upright in their testimonies;
70|34|and who take due care of their Prayer:
70|35|all these shall live honourably in the Gardens.
70|36|But what is the matter with the unbelievers who are hurrying towards you
70|37|in crowds, both on the right and on the left?
70|38|Does everyone of them wish to enter the Garden of Bliss?
70|39|By no means! They know that which We have created them from.
70|40|I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We have the power
70|41|to replace them by others who would be better than they; and We shall certainly not be overpowered.
70|42|So leave them to engage in vain talk and to amuse themselves until they come face to face with the Day which they are promised,
70|43|the Day on which they will hastily come forth from their graves, as though they were hurrying on to the altars of their deities.
70|44|Their eyes will be downcast and disgrace will overwhelm them. Such is the Day that they were promised.
