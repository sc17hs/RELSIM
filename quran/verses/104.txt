104|1|Woe to every fault-finding backbiter;
104|2|who amasses wealth and counts it over and again.
104|3|He thinks that his wealth will immortalise him forever.
104|4|Nay, he shall be thrown into the Crusher.
104|5|And what do you know what the Crusher is?
104|6|It is the Fire kindled by Allah,
104|7|the Fire that shall rise to the hearts (of criminals).
104|8|Verily it will close in upon them,
104|9|in outstretched columns.
