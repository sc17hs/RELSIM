75|1|Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection;
75|2|and nay, I swear by the self-reproaching soul!
75|3|Does man imagine that We will not be able to bring his bones together again?
75|4|Yes indeed; We have the power to remould even his finger-tips.
75|5|But man desires to persist in his evil ways.
75|6|He asks: “When will the Day of Resurrection be?”
75|7|When the sight is dazed,
75|8|and the moon is eclipsed,
75|9|and the sun and the moon are joined together,
75|10|on that Day will man say: “Whither the refuge?”
75|11|No, there is no refuge.
75|12|With your Lord alone will be the retreat that Day.
75|13|On that Day will man be apprised of his deeds, both the earlier and the later.
75|14|But lo, man is well aware of himself,
75|15|even though he might make up excuses.
75|16|(O Prophet), do not stir your tongue hastily (to commit the Revelation to memory).
75|17|Surely it is for Us to have you commit it to memory and to recite it.
75|18|And so when We recite it, follow its recitation attentively;
75|19|then it will be for Us to explain it.
75|20|Nay; the truth is that you love ardently (the good of this world) that can be obtained hastily,
75|21|and are oblivious of the Hereafter.
75|22|Some faces on that Day will be fresh and resplendent,
75|23|and will be looking towards their Lord;
75|24|and some faces on that Day will be gloomy,
75|25|believing that a crushing calamity is about to strike them.
75|26|Nay; when a man's soul reaches up to the throat,
75|27|and it is said: “Is there any enchanter who can step forward and help (by his chanting)?”
75|28|and he realises that the hour of parting is come,
75|29|and calf is inter-twined with calf.
75|30|On that Day you will be driven to your Lord.
75|31|But he did not verify the Truth, nor did he observe Prayer;
75|32|on the contrary, he gave the lie to the Truth and turned his back upon it,
75|33|then he went back to his kinsfolk, elated with pride.
75|34|This (attitude) is worthy of you, altogether worthy;
75|35|again, it is worthy of you, altogether worthy.
75|36|Does man think that he will be left alone, unquestioned?
75|37|Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen,
75|38|then he became a clot, and then Allah made it into a living body and proportioned its parts,
75|39|and then He made of him a pair, male and female?
75|40|Does He, then, not have the power to bring back the dead to life?
