68|1|Nun. By the pen and what the scribes write.
68|2|By your Lord's Grace, you are not afflicted with madness,
68|3|and surely yours shall be a never-ending reward,
68|4|and you are certainly on the most exalted standard of moral excellence.
68|5|So you will soon see, and they too will see,
68|6|which of you is afflicted with madness.
68|7|Surely your Lord knows well those who have strayed from His Way just as He knows well those who are on the Right Way.
68|8|Do not, then, yield to those who reject the Truth, decrying it as false;
68|9|they would wish you to be pliant so that they too may be pliant.
68|10|And do not yield to any contemptible swearer,
68|11|the fault-finder who goes around slandering,
68|12|the hinderer of good, the transgressor, the sinful;
68|13|the coarse-grained, and above all mean and ignoble;
68|14|(who so acts) simply because he has wealth and sons,
68|15|and whenever Our verses are rehearsed to him, he says: “These are fairy- tales of times gone by.”
68|16|Soon shall We brand him on his snout.
68|17|We have put them [i.e., the Makkans] to test even as We put to test the owners of the orchard when they vowed that they would gather the fruit of their orchard in the morning,
68|18|without making any allowance (for the will of Allah).
68|19|Thereupon a calamity from your Lord passed over it while they were asleep,
68|20|and so by morning the orchard lay as though it had been fully harvested.
68|21|At daybreak they called out to one another:
68|22|“Hurry to your orchard if you would gather its fruit.”
68|23|So off they went, whispering to one another:
68|24|“No destitute person shall enter it today.”
68|25|They went forth early, believing that they had the power (to gather the fruit).
68|26|But as soon as they beheld the orchard, (they cried out): “We have certainly lost the way;
68|27|rather, we are utterly ruined.”
68|28|The best among them said: “Did I not say to you: why do you not give glory to (your Lord)?”
68|29|They cried out: “Glory be to our Lord! Certainly we were sinners.”
68|30|Then they began to reproach one another.
68|31|They said: “Woe to us! We had indeed transgressed.
68|32|Maybe our Lord will give us a better orchard in its place; to our Lord do we penitently turn.”
68|33|Such is the chastisement; and the chastisement of the Hereafter is assuredly even greater, if only they knew.
68|34|Surely the God-fearing shall have Gardens of bliss with their Lord.
68|35|What! Shall We treat those who have submitted (to Our command) like those who have acted as criminals?
68|36|What is the matter with you? How ill do you judge!
68|37|Or do you have a Book wherein you read
68|38|that (in the Hereafter) you shall have all that you choose for yourselves?
68|39|Or have We sworn a covenant with you which We are bound to keep till the Day of Resurrection, (a covenant requiring that whatever you ordain for yourselves shall be yours)?
68|40|Ask them: “Which of them can guarantee that?
68|41|Or has something been guaranteed by any of those whom they associate with Allah in His Divinity?” If so, let them bring forth their associates, if they are truthful.
68|42|On the Day when the dreadful calamity will unfold, when people will be summoned to prostrate themselves, and yet they will not be able to prostrate.
68|43|Their eyes shall be downcast and ignominy shall overwhelm them. For when they were safe and sound, they were summoned to prostrate themselves, (and they refused).
68|44|So leave Me, (O Prophet), to deal with him who gives the lie to this Discourse. We shall draw them little by little (to their undoing) in a way that they will not know.
68|45|I am giving them a respite. Great is My scheme!
68|46|Or are you asking them for some compensation so that they feel burdened with debt?
68|47|Or do they have any knowledge of the Unseen which they are now writing down?
68|48|So bear with patience until the Judgement of your Lord comes, and do not belike the man in the fish (i.e., Jonah) who called out, choking with grief:
68|49|had his Lord not bestowed His favour upon him, he would have been cast upon that barren shore (and would have remained there) in disgrace.
68|50|But his Lord exalted him, and included him among His righteous servants.
68|51|When the unbelievers hear this Exhortation, they look at you as though they would knock you off your feet with their (hostile) glances. They say: “Surely he is afflicted with madness”;
68|52|although this is nothing but an Exhortation (to goodness) for everyone in the world.
