90|1|Nay! I swear by this city
90|2|– this city wherein you have been rendered violable–
90|3|and I swear by the parent and his offspring:
90|4|Verily We have created man into toil and hardship.
90|5|Does he think that no one can overpower him?
90|6|He says: “I have squandered enormous wealth.”
90|7|Does he believe that none has seen him?
90|8|Did We not grant him two eyes,
90|9|and a tongue and two lips?
90|10|And did We not show him the two highroads (of good and evil)?
90|11|But he did not venture to scale the difficult steep.
90|12|And what do you know what that difficult steep is?
90|13|It is freeing someone's neck from slavery;
90|14|or giving food on a day of hunger
90|15|to an orphan near of kin;
90|16|or to a destitute lying in dust;
90|17|and, then besides this, he be one of those who believed, and enjoined upon one another steadfastness and enjoined upon one another compassion.
90|18|These are the People of the Right Hand.
90|19|As for those who rejected Our Signs, they are the People of the Left Hand.
90|20|Upon them shall be a Fire that will hem them in.
