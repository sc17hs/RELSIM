100|1|By (the horses) that charge snorting,
100|2|then raise sparks of fire (by their hoofs),
100|3|then raid by the dawn,
100|4|and blaze a trail of dust,
100|5|and penetrate deep into a host.
100|6|Verily man is most ungrateful to his Lord;
100|7|and he himself is a witness to that,
100|8|and surely he loves riches with a passionate loving.
100|9|Is he not aware that when whatever lies (buried) in the graves is overthrown;
100|10|and the secrets of the hearts are laid bare (and examined)?
100|11|Surely on that Day will their Lord be fully informed about them.
