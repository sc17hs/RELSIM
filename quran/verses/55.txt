55|1|The Merciful One
55|2|has taught the Qur'an,
55|3|has created man,
55|4|and has taught him articulate speech.
55|5|The sun and the moon follow a reckoning,
55|6|and the stars and the trees all prostrate themselves,
55|7|and He has raised up the heaven and has set a balance
55|8|that you may not transgress in the balance,
55|9|but weigh things equitably and skimp not in the balance.
55|10|And He has set up the earth for all beings.
55|11|Therein are fruit and palm-trees with their dates in sheaths,
55|12|and a variety of corn with both husk and grain.
55|13|Which of the bounties of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|14|He has created man from dry, rotten clay like the potter's,
55|15|and has created the jinn from the flame of fire.
55|16|Which of the wonders of your Lord's power will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|17|Lord of the two easts and of the two wests is He.
55|18|Which of the powers of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|19|He unleashed the two seas so that they merge together,
55|20|and yet there is a barrier between them which they may not overstep.

55|22|From these seas come forth pearls and coral.

55|26|All that is on earth will perish,
55|27|only the Person of your Lord, full of majesty and splendour, will endure.
55|28|So which of the wonders of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|29|All in the heavens and the earth entreat Him for their needs; a new, mighty task engages Him each day.

55|39|On that Day there will be no need to ask either men or jinn about their sins.
55|40|(We shall see) which of the favours of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|41|The culprits shall be known by their marks, and shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet.
55|42|Which of the powers of your Lord, will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|43|(It will be said): “This is the Hell that the culprits had cried lies to.
55|44|They will keep circling around between Hell and boiling water.
55|45|Which of your Lord's powers will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny?
55|46|For any who fears to stand before his Lord are two Gardens.
