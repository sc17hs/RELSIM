79|1|By those (angels) that pluck out the soul from depths,
79|2|and gently take it away;
79|3|and by those that speedily glide along (the cosmos),
79|4|and vie with the others (in carrying out their Lord's behests);
79|5|and then manage the affairs of the Universe (according to their Lord's commands).
79|6|The Day when the quaking will cause a violent convulsion,
79|7|and will be followed by another quaking.
79|8|On that Day some hearts shall tremble (with fright),
79|9|and their eyes shall be downcast with dread.
79|10|They say: “Shall we indeed be restored to life,
79|11|even after we have been reduced to bones, hollow and rotten?”
79|12|They say: “That will then be a return with a great loss!”
79|13|Surely they will need no more than a single stern blast,
79|14|and lo, they will all be in the open plain.
79|15|Has Moses' story reached you?
79|16|When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa,
79|17|and directed him: “Go to Pharaoh, he has rebelled,
79|18|and say to him: 'Are you willing to be purified,
79|19|that I may direct you to your Lord and then you hold Him in awe?'”
79|20|Then Moses (went to Pharaoh and) showed him the Great Sign;
79|21|but he denied it as false and disobeyed,
79|22|and then he turned back to have recourse to his craftiness,
79|23|and gathered his people and declared:
79|24|“I am the supreme lord of you all.”
79|25|Thereupon Allah seized him for the chastisement of the World to Come as well as of the present.
79|26|Surely there is a great lesson in it for whoever would fear (Allah).
79|27|Is it harder to create you or the heaven? But Allah built it,
79|28|and raised its vault high and proportioned it;
79|29|and covered its night with darkness and brought forth from it its day;
79|30|and thereafter spread out the earth,
79|31|and brought out of it its water and its pasture,
79|32|and firmly fixed in it mountains;
79|33|all this as provision for you and your cattle.
79|34|But when the great calamity will come about
79|35|on the Day when man will recall all his strivings,
79|36|and Hell will be brought in sight for anyone to see:
79|37|then he who transgressed
79|38|and preferred the life of this world,
79|39|most surely his abode shall be Hell.
79|40|But he who feared to stand before his Lord, and restrained himself from evil desires,
79|41|most surely his abode shall be Paradise.
79|42|They ask you about the Hour: “When will it be?”
79|43|What concern do you have to speak about that?
79|44|Its knowledge rests with your Lord.
79|45|You are only a warner to him who has a fear of it.
79|46|On the Day they see it, they will feel as though they had stayed (in the grave) no more than one evening or one morning.
