56|1|When the Event will come to pass
56|2|– and then there will be no one to deny its occurrence –
56|3|(a calamitous Event) that shall turn things upside down:
56|4|when the earth will suddenly shake with a terrible shaking,
56|5|and the mountains will crumble
56|6|and will scatter abroad into fine dust.
56|7|You shall then become three groups.
56|8|The People on the Right: and how fortunate will be the People on the Right!
56|9|And the People on the Left: and how miserable will be the People on the Left!
56|10|As for the Foremost, they will be the foremost!
56|11|They shall be near-stationed (to their Lord),
56|12|in the Gardens of Bliss.
56|13|A throng of the ancients,
56|14|and a few from later times.
56|15|They (will be seated) on gold-encrusted couches,
56|16|reclining on them, arrayed face to face;
56|17|immortal youths shall go about them
56|18|with goblets and ewers and a cup filled with a drink drawn from a running spring,
56|19|a drink by which their minds will not be clouded nor will it cause drunkenness;
56|20|they will also go about them with the fruits of which they may choose,
56|21|and with the flesh of any fowl that they may desire to eat;
56|22|and there shall be wide-eyed maidens,
56|23|beautiful as pearls hidden in their shells.
56|24|All this shall be theirs as a reward for their deeds.
56|25|There they shall hear no idle talk nor any sinful speech.
56|26|All talk will be sound and upright.
56|27|As for the People on the Right, how fortunate shall be the people on the Right!
56|28|They shall be in the midst of thornless lote trees,
56|29|and flower-clad acacias,
56|30|and extended shade,
56|31|and gushing water,
56|32|and abundant fruit,
56|33|never-ending and unforbidden.
56|34|They shall be on upraised couches,
56|35|and their spouses We shall have brought them into being afresh,
56|36|and shall have made them virgins,
56|37|intensely loving and of matching age.
56|38|All this will be for the People on the Right;
56|39|a large throng from the ancients,
56|40|and also a large throng from those of later times.
56|41|As for the People on the Left: how miserable will be the People on the Left!
56|42|They will be in the midst of scorching wind and boiling water,
56|43|and a shade of thick, pitch-black smoke,
56|44|which will neither be cool nor soothing.
56|45|Surely they had lived before in luxury,
56|46|and had persisted in the Great Sin.
56|47|They used to say: “What! Once we are dead and are reduced to dust and bones, shall we still be raised to a new life from the dead?
56|48|(We) and our fore-fathers of yore?”
56|49|Tell them, (O Prophet): “The earlier ones and the later ones
56|50|shall all be brought together on an appointed Day.
56|51|Then you, the erring ones and those that gave the lie to the Truth,
56|52|shall all eat from the Tree of al-Zaqqum,
56|53|filling your bellies with it;
56|54|and thereupon you shall drink boiling water,
56|55|drinking it as thirsty camels do.”
56|56|Thus shall they be entertained on the Day of Recompense.
56|57|We have created you, then why would you not confirm it?
56|58|Did you ever consider the sperm that you emit?
56|59|Do you create a child out of it, or are We its creators?
56|60|It is We Who ordained death upon you and We are not to be frustrated.
56|61|Had We so wished, nothing could have hindered Us from replacing you by others like yourselves, or transforming you into beings you know nothing about.
56|62|You are well aware of the first creation; then, do you learn no lesson from it?
56|63|Have you considered the seeds you till?
56|64|Is it you or We Who make them grow?
56|65|If We so wished, We could have reduced your harvest to rubble, and you would have been left wonder-struck to exclaim:
56|66|“We have been penalised;
56|67|nay; we have been undone!”
56|68|Did you cast a good look at the water that you drink?
56|69|Is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it We Who brought it down?
56|70|If We had so pleased, We could have made it bitter. So why would you not give thanks?
56|71|Did you consider the fire which you kindle?
56|72|Did you make its tree grow or was it We Who made it grow?
56|73|We made it a reminder and a provision for the needy.
56|74|Glorify, then, (O Prophet), the name of your Great Lord.
56|75|No! I swear by the positions of the stars –
56|76|and this is indeed a mighty oath, if only you knew –
56|77|that this indeed is a noble Qur'an,
56|78|inscribed in a well-guarded Book,
56|79|which none but the pure may touch;
56|80|a revelation from the Lord of the Universe.
56|81|Do you, then, take this discourse in light esteem,
56|82|and your portion in it is simply that you denounce it as false?
56|83|Why, then, when the soul leaps up to the throat,
56|84|the while you are helplessly watching that he is on the verge of death,
56|85|– at that moment when We are closer to him than you, although you do not see (Us)
56|86|if you are not subject to anyone's authority,
56|87|why are you then not able to bring them back to life if you are truthful?
56|88|So if he is one of those who are near-stationed (to Allah),
56|89|then happiness and delight and Gardens of Bliss are his.
56|90|And if he is one of the People on the Right,
56|91|he will be welcomed by the words: “Peace to you” from the People on the Right.
56|92|And if he is one of those who give the lie (to this Message) and go astray,
56|93|then he will be served boiling water,
56|94|and will be scorched by the Fire.
56|95|That indeed is the absolute truth.
56|96|So glorify the name of your Great Lord.
