54|1|The Hour of Resurrection drew near and the moon split asunder.
54|2|(Regardless of any Signs these people see), they turn away and say: “This is an ongoing sorcery.”
54|3|They also gave the lie to (the splitting asunder of the moon) and only followed their desires. Yet everything is destined to reach an end.
54|4|Surely there came to them narratives (of the ancient nations) that should suffice to deter (them from transgression),
54|5|narratives that are full of consummate wisdom. But warnings do not avail them.
54|6|So turn away from them, (O Prophet). On the Day when a caller shall call them to a thing most terrible,
54|7|with down-cast eyes they shall go forth from their graves, as though they were scattered locusts.
54|8|They shall be hurrying forth towards the caller, and the unbelievers (who had once denied this Day), will say: “This is a woeful Day.”
54|9|Before them Noah's people also gave the lie (to his Message). They rejected Our servant as a liar, saying: “He is a madman”; and he was rebuffed.
54|10|Then he called upon His Lord: “Verily I am vanquished; so come You to my aid.”
54|11|Thereupon We opened the gates of the sky for water to pour down,
54|12|and We made the earth burst forth with springs, and all this water converged to fulfil that which had been decreed.
54|13|And We bore Noah on the vessel built of planks and nails,
54|14|which sailed on under Our supervision: a reward for him who had been shown ingratitude.
54|15|And We left the Ark as a Sign. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|16|So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|17|We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|18|'Ad also gave the lie (to Hud). So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|19|We sent a tumultuous wind against them on a day of unremitting misfortune,
54|20|which tore people away and hurled them as though they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.
54|21|So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|22|We have made the Qur'an easy to derive lessons from. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|23|Thamud gave the lie to the warnings,
54|24|saying: “Are we to follow a single mortal, one from among ourselves? If we do that, we shall surely be in error and folly.
54|25|Was there none but he to whom the Reminder could be vouchsafed excluding all others? Nay; he is an insolent liar.”
54|26|(We told Our Messenger): “Tomorrow they shall know who is the insolent liar.
54|27|We shall send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch their end with patience.
54|28|Let them know that the water should be divided between them and the she-camel, each availing their turn.”
54|29|Eventually, they summoned their companion, and he undertook the (outrageous) task and hamstrung the she-camel.
54|30|So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings!
54|31|Behold, We sent a single Blast against them, and they became like the trampled twigs of a sheep pen-builder.
54|32|Surely We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|33|Lot's people also gave the lie to the warnings,
54|34|and behold, We let loose upon them a tempest which rained stones upon them, except upon Lot's household whom We rescued in the last hours of the night
54|35|as a favour from Us. Thus do We reward those who give thanks.
54|36|Surely Lot warned his people that We shall seize them (with Our chastisement), but they doubted the warnings.
54|37|Then they even solicited his guests from him, whereupon We blotted out their eyes, (telling them): “Now have a taste of My chastisement and My warnings.”
54|38|Indeed an abiding chastisement came upon them in the morning.
54|39|So have a taste of My chastisement and My warnings.
54|40|Surely We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed?
54|41|Warnings also came to the Pharaonites,
54|42|but they gave the lie to Our Signs, to all of them. Thereupon We seized them with the seizing of the Most Mighty, the Most Powerful.
54|43|Are your unbelievers (of Makkah) any better than they? Or have you been granted any immunity in the Scriptures?
54|44|Or do they say: “We are a strong legion, strong enough for victory?”
54|45|Soon shall this legion be routed and shall turn their backs and flee.
54|46|Nay; the Hour of Doom is their appointed time, and the Hour shall be more calamitous and bitter.
54|47|The evil-doers are victims of error and madness.
54|48|There shall come a Day when they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire and will be told: “Now taste the flame of Hell.”
54|49|We have created everything in a determined measure.
54|50|Our command consists of only one Word which is carried out in the twinkling of an eye.
54|51|We did indeed destroy many like you. Is there, then, any who will heed?
54|52|All their deeds are recorded in the Scrolls;
54|53|everything large or small, is duly inscribed.
54|54|Surely those who shun disobedience will dwell amidst Gardens and running streams
54|55|where they will be honourably seated in the presence of a King, Mighty in Power.
