67|1|Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of the Universe, and Who has power over everything;
67|2|Who created death and life that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving;
67|3|Who created the seven heavens one upon another. You will see no incongruity in the Merciful One's creation. Turn your vision again, can you see any flaw?
67|4|Then turn your vision again, and then again; in the end your vision will come back to you, worn out and frustrated.
67|5|We have adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and have made them a means to drive away the satans. We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blazing Fire.
67|6|The chastisement of Hell awaits those who disbelieve in their Lord. What a wretched destination!
67|7|When they will be cast into it, they will hear it roar as it boils,
67|8|as though it will burst with rage. Every time a multitude is cast into it, its keepers will ask them: “Did no warner come to you?”
67|9|They will say: “Yes, a warner came to us, but we gave the lie to him and said: 'Allah has revealed nothing. You are surely in huge error.'
67|10|They will say: 'If we had only listened and understood, we would not be among the inmates of the Blazing Fire.'”
67|11|Thus will they confess their sins. Damned are these inmates of the Blazing Fire.
67|12|Surely forgiveness and a mighty reward await those who fear Allah without seeing Him.
67|13|Whether you speak in secrecy or aloud, (it is all the same to Allah). He even knows the secrets that lie hidden in the breasts of people.
67|14|Would He not know, He Who has created, when He is All-Subtle, All-Aware?
67|15|He it is Who made the earth subservient to you. So traverse in its tracks and partake of the sustenance He has provided. To Him will you be resurrected.
67|16|Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to cave in with you, and then suddenly it will begin to rock violently?
67|17|Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not let loose upon you a storm of stones? Then shall you know what My warning is like!
67|18|Those who came before them also gave the lie (to the Messengers): then how awesome was My chastisement!
67|19|Have they not seen birds above them spreading and closing their wings, with none holding them except the Merciful One? He oversees everything.
67|20|Which is your army that will come to your aid against the Merciful Lord? But the unbelievers are in utter delusion.
67|21|Who shall provide for you if He withholds His sustenance? Nay; but they persist in rebellion and aversion.
67|22|Who is better guided: he who walks grovelling on his face, or he who walks upright on a Straight Path?
67|23|Say: “He it is Who has brought you into being, and has given you hearing and sight, and has given you hearts to think and understand. How seldom do you give thanks!”
67|24|Say: “Allah it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you will be mustered.”
67|25|They say: “If you are truthful, tell us when will this promise (of the Hereafter) be fulfilled?”
67|26|Say: “Allah alone knows about that; and I am no more than a plain warner.”
67|27|When they will see it near at hand, the faces of all those who had denied it will be distraught, and then they will be told: “This is the doom which you used to ask for.”
67|28|Say to them: “Did you ever consider: whether Allah destroys me and those that are with me, or shows mercy to us, who can protect the unbelievers from a grievous chastisement?”
67|29|Say to them: “He is Merciful, and it is in Him that we believe, and it is in Him that we put all our trust. Soon will you know who is in manifest error.”
67|30|Say to them: “Did you even consider: if all the water that you have (in the wells) were to sink down into the depths of the earth, who will produce for you clear, flowing water?”
