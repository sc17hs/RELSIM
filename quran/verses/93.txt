93|1|By the bright forenoon,
93|2|and by the night when it covers the world with peace:
93|3|(O Prophet), your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased.
93|4|Indeed what is to come will be better for you than what has gone by.
93|5|Verily your Lord will soon give you so amply that you will be well-pleased.
93|6|Did He not find you an orphan and then gave you shelter?
93|7|Did He not find you unaware of the Right Way, and then directed you to it?
93|8|And did He not find you in want, and then enriched you?
93|9|Therefore, be not harsh with the orphan;
93|10|and chide not him who asks,
93|11|and proclaim the bounty of your Lord.
