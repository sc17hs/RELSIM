96|1|Recite in the name of your Lord Who created,
96|2|created man from a clot of congealed blood.
96|3|Recite: and your Lord is Most Generous,
96|4|Who taught by the pen,
96|5|taught man what he did not know.
96|6|Nay, surely man transgresses;
96|7|for he believes himself to be self-sufficient.
96|8|Surely to your Lord is your return.
96|9|Did you see him who forbids
96|10|a servant (of Allah) when he prays?
96|11|Did you consider: what if he is on the Right Way,
96|12|and enjoins piety?
96|13|Did you consider: what if he gives the lie (to the Truth) and turns away (from it)?
96|14|Does he not know that Allah sees everything?
96|15|No indeed; if he does not desist, We shall drag him by the forelock;
96|16|by the lying forelock steeped in sin.
96|17|So let him summon his helpmates;
96|18|We too shall summon the guards of Hell.
96|19|No, not at all. Never obey him. But prostrate yourself and become nigh (to your Lord).
