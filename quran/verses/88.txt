88|1|Has the news of the overwhelming event reached you?
88|2|Some faces that Day shall be downcast with fear,
88|3|be toiling and worn-out;
88|4|they shall burn in a Scorching Fire;
88|5|their drink shall be from a boiling spring.
88|6|They shall have no food except bitter dry thorns
88|7|that will neither nourish nor satisfy their hunger.
88|8|On that very Day some faces shall be radiant with joy,
88|9|well-pleased with their striving.
88|10|They will be in a lofty Garden
88|11|wherein they shall hear no vain talk.
88|12|In it there shall be a flowing spring,
88|13|and couches raised high,
88|14|and goblets laid out,
88|15|and cushions arrayed in rows,
88|16|and rich carpets levelled out.
88|17|Do (these unbelievers) not observe the camels: how they were created?
88|18|And the sky: how it was raised high?
88|19|And the mountains: how they were fixed?
88|20|And the earth: how it was spread out?
88|21|So render good counsel, for you are simply required to counsel,
88|22|and are not invested with the authority to compel them.
88|23|But whoever will turn away (from the Truth),
88|24|Allah will chastise him with the most terrible chastisement.
88|25|Surely to Us is their return;
88|26|and then it is for Us to call them to account.
