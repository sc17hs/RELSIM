44|1|Ha'. Mim.
44|2|By the Clear Book.
44|3|We revealed it on a Blessed Night, for We were intent on warning;
44|4|(We revealed it on the Night) wherein every matter is wisely determined
44|5|by Our command. Verily, We were set to send a Messenger
44|6|as a Mercy from your Lord. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing,
44|7|the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them: if you would only have sure faith.
44|8|There is no god but He: He gives life and causes death. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of yore.
44|9|(But the fact is, they lack certainty) and frolic about in doubt.
44|10|So watch for the Day when the sky will come down with a pall of smoke,
44|11|enveloping people. That will be a grievous scourge.
44|12|(People will then say): “Our Lord, remove this scourge from us; we shall believe.”
44|13|But how will they take heed? Such are they that a Messenger came to them clearly expounding the Truth,
44|14|yet they turned away from him and said: “This is a well-tutored madman.”
44|15|Yet We will hold the scourge back for a while, (but no sooner than We will do so) you will revert to your old ways.
44|16|The Day when We shall seize them with a mighty seizing, that will be the Day on which We shall inflict upon you full retribution.
44|17|Indeed before that We subjected the Pharaonites to the same test. A noble Messenger came to them
44|18|(and said): “Deliver to me Allah's servants. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you,
44|19|and do not exalt yourselves in defiance of Allah. I have come to you with a clear authority (as a Messenger).
44|20|I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you should attack me with stones.
44|21|But if you do not believe what I say, leave me alone (and desist from laying hands on me).”
44|22|Then he called upon his Lord: “These are a criminal people.”
44|23|(He was told): “Set out with My servants by night for you will certainly be pursued.
44|24|And leave the sea behind you as calm as ever. Surely they are an army that is doomed to be drowned.”
44|25|How many gardens did they leave behind, and how many fountains
44|26|and sown fields and splendid mansions,
44|27|and the life of ease in which they took delight!
44|28|Thus it was; and We made another people inherit all that.
44|29|Then neither the sky shed tears over them nor the earth. They were granted no respite.
44|30|Thus did We deliver the Children of Israel from the humiliating chastisement,
44|31|from Pharaoh who was most prominent among the prodigals.
44|32|We knowingly exalted them (i.e., the Children of Israel) above other peoples of the world
44|33|and bestowed upon them the Signs wherein lay an evident test for them.
44|34|Indeed these people say:
44|35|“This is our first and only death, and we shall never be raised again.
44|36|Bring back to us our fathers if you are truthful.”
44|37|Are these better or the people of Tubba and those who went before them? We destroyed them for they were a criminal people.
44|38|It was not in idle sport that We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them.
44|39|We did not create them except in Truth. But most of them do not know.
44|40|The Day of Final Decision is the appointed time for all;
44|41|the Day when a friend shall be of no avail to his friend nor shall they be helped,
44|42|except those to whom Allah shows mercy. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Compassionate.
44|43|The tree of al-Zaqqum
44|44|shall be the food of the sinful.
44|45|Like dregs of oil, it will boil in their bellies
44|46|like boiling water.
44|47|“Seize him and drag him to the middle of the Blazing Fire,
44|48|then pour boiling water over his head as chastisement.
44|49|Taste this, you are a person mighty and noble!
44|50|This is what you used to doubt.”
44|51|Verily the God-fearing shall be in a secure place
44|52|amidst gardens and springs.
44|53|Attired in silk and brocade, they shall be arrayed face to face.
44|54|Thus shall it be: and We shall espouse them to fair, wide-eyed maidens.
44|55|While resting in security, they shall call for all kinds of fruit.
44|56|They shall not taste death except the death in this world. And Allah will save them from the chastisement of Hell
44|57|as a favour from your Lord. That is the great triumph.
44|58|(O Prophet), We have made this Book easy in your tongue so that they may take heed.
44|59|Wait, then; they too are waiting.
